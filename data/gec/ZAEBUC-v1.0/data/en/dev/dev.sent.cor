Social media has a negative effect and a positive effect on our lives; 95% of kids use social media in their life more than sitting with their families; moreover, social media's side effects are that people are too lazy to use their brain. Generally, social media has a good habit that half of our shopping is online and on Instagram and this stuff. As I see, social media is too important to me; I can read online books and shop online, but our problem is how it affects our society; our new generation can't depend on  itself because the whole world is supporting social media; it affects  our families the most because family gatherings are now under the title of """Sit" in "silence""." Why? Because all of them are using their mobile phones, and it's a bad habit; it will affect our traditional ways of sitting with our grandmothers. As I see, people have to control their use of social media to have more time with their kids.
Social media affects  the people at work, and it takes their time; and being lazy about studying, they can't focus on studying. Also, social media has positive and negative ways to affect society; the  positive    things are that we can connect with other people and countries in easy ways, and we can get more information for learning and studying. Overall, the negative ways are that it takes time from the people, and that family or friends are alone; also, they can't  meet with others (like gather) because everyone is busy with their phone, so the big problem  is that maybe some hackers steal your information when you share it on your social media. Finally, I think you should be careful and  not use your phone for more than 5 hours in one day; that's for your health and your body.
I think that now, the social media is affecting the whole world, not just a specific area. For the last century or, if I want to be specific, the last 10 years, everyone in the world should have accounts on any application coming newly, like Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook.  No one can continue the day without  just looking for any application and seeing the updates, and this affects the person in his life and work. The life now has no privacy because now, people  share everything with people in another place; for example, they share where  they went to eat and what they bought. On the other hand, people also follow the bloggers and famous persons on social media, like an artist, singer or blogger, and they follow their daily life,  then   they become jealous of their life,  they wish the same life for themselves and they start to find  anything they do  to reach money and have a rich life without  caring if it is a bad or good way. People also can find a wife or husband on social media. Social media can cause problems between  family and friends; for example, if they see someone  go out without telling them, they get mad and angry, and it is a bad effect on society.
In my opinion, I think that the most important developments in the UAE now are the people who live in it and the government.  They are the most important because they can improve their country; also, they have  loyalty for the UAE. Furthermore, the UAE government does all the things that can help its people,  support them and give them power to show the world what they can do as  people who developed many things in their country  by helping each other.  Also, I think I'm one of these people; I,  as a student,  can develop  myself and my country; how? I can do it by studying hard and working hard to help my government and my country. I want to become a very important person and have my own work after my government;  also, we should  put our country among different countries in the world and show that we have the most important developments at the moment  and all, and that is thanks to the UAE people and the UAE government.  So we  thank God and ourselves for having all these things in our lives.  I'm so proud of  myself and my country; so thank you, my government and people. 
Social media affects our life. People have different connections on social media; that means it will have different effects on the people. It  depends on how the person uses it. So some people use it in the good way, and some people do not. This is the main issue because there are many  negative people on social media. They are affecting  many people by saying many things that did not happen or aren't real just to make a big move in the world or to be famous, but there are some rules from the government to stop these people. However, there are many people who use it in the good way,  make good relationships  with other people from different countries and get to know each other; also, they know about other cultures. This makes our world better and stronger. So there are two ways to use social media; some people use the true way, and some people do not. Our responsibility is that the parents need to encourage their children to use it in the good way. Also, they need to check everything  with their children. The government should have some rules to stop the bad people on social media.
Most people  use social media in [INCOMPLETE]
  Nowadays,  there are a lot of issues that can affect people and the community. First of all, social media can affect many things, like young people,  because there are a lot of people who use social media in a bad way;  that's why young people face this problem. Also, social media can affect some societies. For example,  famous people share their life, and people copy everything  that they did. Although social media had a lot of issues,  people are still using it again. Secondly, the government should  control and take more responsibility; maybe it will solve this problem to change in a good way. Moreover, there are a lot of people who die because they use bad words; that can affect parents also. However, the government and people should change and think more about whether they  use social media properly and in a positive way. Also, some countries affect  another country. Maybe war will  happen between the countries; so social media should be used in a good way to be safe. 
The social media is spreading all over the world day by day. Many societies are changing  their thoughts or way of thinking because of that. However, some people are getting a high effect by that, for example, how they see and easily spread their photos or talk with the outer world by contacting and sharing with it and also sharing their cultures together to get the knowledge and be aware of others; and it might change people's way of living. For example, Arabs' eating habits are changing, like eating McDonald's more than eating machboos. Even though people may think differently than they did in the UAE many years ago, the community is all connected together and has  one vision, which is improving the country without social media. Nowadays, people have  many different visions, such as how to attract the tourists or make social media better by spreading posters and letting leaders talk through an app. We can easily be affected by the social media because now we are living in a world where  computers and mobile phones are controlling us; we use them every day and anywhere too. In the other hand, many people are mad because their children are not behaving well as they used to  in the past. Society is changing  over time more and more.
  Nowadays, social media is one of the most important things in our life. It makes a big change in the world. Social media has good and bad effects, so we will see how  social media affects individuals and society. Social media means how we contact with our friends, family or the world but without seeing them, so we use it to contact with the world. Social media has many effects in our personality and society. First, how does social media affect individuals? There are good sides and bad sides. On the positive side, social media helps the person to know about the world, so he will know about different cultures. That  means he will be able to contact with whom will help to improve his communication skills. Also, social media helps the person to contact with his friends or family without  going to them, so he will be more friendly and have  strong relationships. Sometimes, social media gives the person a chance to change his life, because he can use social media in a good way. He can open a small business, which will help him to be more responsible. In the other hand, if the person uses the social media in the wrong way, it will affect his personality and life. Some people use social media a lot so they forget their real life. This will affect their study and their relationships. Second, how does social media affect society? On the positive side, social media helps people to be together every time, so they will have  strong relationships between each other. In addition, social media helps society to develop and improve its culture by knowing what is [INCOMPLETE]
 Social media has a big impact in all our lives now. Most of the social media audience is teenagers and children, and it impacts us in so many ways, in a healthy way or in a psychological way. Most of us sit on the social media for between 4-6   hours every day, and it affects our mental health and many things too. Some of us take it as a life and a job now, and it's those who get affected the most. People use it on every device, like their phone,  computer and  TV. The most affected age is the teenagers and the children.
There are positive and negative impacts of social media; the social media affected  our life, and we can't live it because the social media is very important in our life. We can share the information with other people around the world. Social media websites are the most popular haunts on the Internet. People communicate and socialize on the web. Here is a closer look at the effect of social media on business and study as well as some negative effects, such as bullying and privacy. The negatives are there are many fake webs; some people don't look; they just take the information and share it with other people.  And you mustn't take 24 hours in the social media. Go and see your life.
Social media has played a big role in influencing the way we live now. People aim to show the perfect side of their lives in order to share the moments with the others on social media, which in result makes others try to have the same level of life and perfection even if their financial level does not allow them  that.  As a consequence of that,  society has built an idea that all the celebrities on social media have [INCOMPLETE]
The social media has changed our life since it came to  us. Social media is to contact with your family or friends at any place or time. Social media has  two sides; one of them is good for us, but the other side makes our life crazy. Today, I will write about how  social media affects people and society. First of all, social media can help us  text our friends and family at any time. For example, if you are out of the country and you want to see your family, you can call them by video so you can see them at the same time. I think it's good for us, but a lot of people didn't know that this had a lot of problems in our life. On another hand, social media can affect our life on a negative side. For example, there are a lot of hackers, so they can go in your phone,  take all of the information that is inside the phone and use it in the bad way. For example, they can take  your private photos and ask for money to delete them. To sum up, we must take care of our devices because there are a lot of hackers that hack our phones or devices. In my opinion, we must use the social media in the right way to protect our life. Also, there may be a company that kills all the hackers in our life to save social media.
Social media is about communicating with each other on phones.  Some of the people think it is a bad idea to be all the time on social media;  on the other hand, few  people prefer to use it.  Social media affects a lot of good and bad things; for example, many  people can  know all the news and what is happening in the country or anywhere, but sometimes,  this news  can be false.  On social media, all people can talk about a lot of things and talk about their opinions.  Sometimes,  people on social media affect society, and they make a mess between countries.  In my opinion, social media  affects  individuals and society in good things more than  bad things. 
Social media has evolved tremendously throughout the years and became one of the essentials in an individual's life, which they can't live without. People spend most of their time using social media, whether it is to waste time or get to know people or cultures from around the world. There are a variety of social media platforms that people can use, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Telegram, etc. Social media affects people greatly - whether it's a positive or negative effect - depending on how they use it on a daily basis. There are people who get addicted to social media to the extent where they drop all the necessary stuff they should do or care about (like work, family and friends), get immersed in social media and live in a virtual life to forget their  real-life hardships - whether it's a bad job or a failed marriage - or to get temporarily away from life. Social media can also save people a lot of the time that they could have taken (hours). People get to know people around the world, run everyday errands easily, buy things without having to go outside, text family and friends every day and make schedules that are efficient and easier to use on a daily basis.
As we all know, everything   nowadays is a technological base, and most of us use social media to communicate with others and to  know what happens all around the world. Everything has its positive and negative side, so if we started thinking about how social media contributed to or affected our society, we will find tons of positive and negative  outcomes. As an example, social media made communication much easier, so distance won't be a significant barrier between family and friends; as well as that, we are able to keep up with all the things that are happening all around the world. One of the negative effects is that social media is an online-based  application, so it consumes a lot of energy (which is the Internet), especially electricity, and that is conducted from the trees; in addition, it contributes to global warming. Social media is the easiest way of communication. Most of the human beings use social media to interact with each other. As an example, I personally use social media to communicate with my friends that are studying abroad. I keep up with them since we are living in different places and countries. Families that migrated from their countries use it as a way to see their beloved ones through  social media. In addition, it made communication with new people no longer an issue. The Internet, technology and social media are helping in causing global warming. Electricity is the main form of energy, and the Internet uses electricity as a power source. The electricity that is used is conducted from trees and causes CO2 to be spread more often; that helps in destroying the atmosphere layer. In  conclusion, social media has its advantages and disadvantages. People may agree that it's the best way of communicating with and influencing others, and some will disagree. Everyone chooses the way that they use it.
Question (C). How does social media affect individuals and society? These days, all the people from around the world use social media as their primary source from which they get information and news,  but is it  really that accurate and trusted? The answer would basically be no because they use a wide variety of techniques for you to just click on it - this is called  """clickbait""." It's when the title says something completely different from what is really being told in the passage itself; this completely affects the society. There may be some advantages and disadvantages to this type of title; for example, people can go on YouTube and get help and suggestions if they have any problems  doing something particular; they also use social media for business-related  stuff and training websites for online courses. The disadvantages that could happen are that you concentrate on all the information that is being spread all around social media, and you forget to watch the TV news, like The New York Times,  etc. You also affect the community that is around you and share false information that could lead to terrible pathways. I really would recommend a second choice when it comes to daily news, and make sure that the information you have is reliable and correct before you start to spread rumors.
What do you think our lives will be like without the existence of social media?  Social media has an enormous impact on all societies;  every person alive uses social media   nowadays - all genders and ages. Social media can affect us negatively and positively in our daily lives. Social media is the most entertaining online applications that exist now. First of all, people can get an advantage from it in many ways; they can collect new important information from any of these applications,  meet new people on social media  (online),  chat with their friends and relatives and so on. Social media made people's life easier; they can reach anyone through these applications,  like WhatsApp,  Instagram,  Snapchat,  etc. Social media helps people to read more and do many activities online; people can share their daily life routine, and it gives us a chance to open our minds and think wisely through what we've been watching and collecting online. Otherwise, social media affects people in a negative way. Rumors are everywhere, especially on social media - there are a lot of them,  and people start to accept these rumors, although they're completely wrong. Social media sometimes leads people to the wrong path; they use false information, for example, of something that has happened before in their region or country. Social media can distract students from studying and working hard;  they just sit and hold their phones or laptops so they check their applications if they had any notifications in them. Using social media a lot leads to mental health problems; sometimes,  the screens have electrons, and these electrons might affect our eyes, and they might get red and tired from the long-time  usage. Moreover, social media can lead us to stop thinking out of the box and just rely on the information given in the applications. In  conclusion,  my opinion is to use social media and entertain yourself, but don't use it for a long time so you don't get affected negatively.
Question: How does social media affect individuals and society? At the beginning, the social media is not something new for this generation; it's just going to be new for the older people that  don't know exactly what social media is. Social media has the advantages and disadvantages of everything  that happens on the social media. The social media affects the individuals more than the society; as an example of individuals, they may use the social media in the wrong way, and sometimes they get hurt by the people behind the screens that are using social media. Their parents need to know about their children and how they are  using it. In addition, it also harms the society;      they   get so many bad things from the people where they are living; it's either about their country or the way  their parents are raising them up. Furthermore, it also affects the children who are right now at the age of 5 or 6 years who  play bad video games, and other people on the other side that they play with will say some bad words, and the kids will learn them and use them in their usual days. It's bad, and also they should put red lines for what each age is using  and whom they are speaking to  or even playing with because now, these days, even the children whose age is 5 and above  14 years old  use bad words that  the old generation  didn't even have the right to say;  but every single one should take the responsibilities of what they are doing.
I loved the last topic because it does affect a lot; there are many  reasons why and how  it affects  society. The first reason is that people are all over the social media, so it is a good way for it when you're always on social media. With time, it does affect  society; even when not all are on the media, people will mention it and tell people about it. There are a lot of positives and negatives to it; everything  in life has both sides; like it is positive that people will know more information, and it will develop;   it's negative because problems may happen, which does affect because it may not go with our culture. It is  all over the world; we don't expect that, but it will help more if we just don't. It does depend on how the person   would use it and how he thinks of it. People should get better at it because it will help a lot; it may affect  changing the society in good or bad ways. You must make it in a good way, like selling things that people would need,  talking about good topics that   will make people stronger and feel better or something that could help in studying and achieving goals. The bad thing is that it may affect  people, by the way,  with all of the perfection on social media and some by letting them feel bad or just use it for no good reasons. It will make your thinking  change. Parents don't like it, but I think it is a good thing because you will know better and new information - that is what I think.
Social media Nowadays, people are so affected by the social media as we can see - if not all of us, it's most of us;  personally, I think it depends on how we use it; is it a positive way, or are we  using it to waste our whole day? Social media helped us to contact easily with others; additionally, we can contact anyone from all around the world, which means that it makes our life easier;  also, there are a lot of things that we can learn there;  like you can read online books,  and it's such an easy way to get  information,   and there are a lot of helpful ways to do your business  and to advertise for it. In the other hand, social media can affect others in a negative way,  which is that people spend hours on social media,  ignore their tasks  and spend a whole day doing nothing and just being on social media.  A lot of people use it to bully others on social media, which  can affect so much  the person who gets bullied;  plus, a lot of people now share their personal information publicly, which means they will have to face  identity theft. Finally, as I mentioned, it depends on how you choose to spend your time  and depends on how you use social media.  My advice is not to  get addicted to these applications a lot cause they might affect you in a bad way - use them just for a little time, not the whole day.
How does the social media affect individuals and society? I believe that social media has both good and bad traits; it could help a person in so many ways; for example, if the person was out of the country and wants to communicate with their family or have to finish some certain job, it will be easier, and they don't have to worry that they should be back  or about the traffic and more. The effect of social media  There are kids who have social media accounts; it could be dangerous in some ways; they could reply to strangers, and they could end up in a bad situation; and we can't forget about the online bullying and how it can  affect us;  and the power of social media is that if they dislike a person, they could turn most of the people against them,   tell them to go commit suicide and more, which is not healthy. Because of social media, people don't know how to communicate with others; they prefer to stare at their mobiles for hours than to socialize. People are scared to get out and to talk to people  because most of their lives depend on it;  they can't leave their phone; it's  as if they're a part of them, which is unhealthy; and now, it became that whatever  you do, you should impress the people that are following you, for example, what  you wear and whom you are  friends with; it's as if your business is theirs too.  I believe that they should have a day - every month or week - which they spend  with their loved ones  and away from the Internet.
Nowadays, social media became a foundation for our lives. No one can live without using at least one of the apps provided;  they are the key to start relationships and stay in contact with your friends, families and  loved ones. Many people find a big challenge in meeting others and making friends. Social media is a great way to help them overcome their fears and help them become more social and interact with the society in many different ways. Each app has its own distinctive way;  now, an individual can basically be everywhere at his home;  some apps allow texting and others allow video chatting. Either way, they help those people that live in fear of meeting new people in a way or another by interacting with them from a place where they feel completely safe and secure. On the other hand,  some people develop a condition called  """Social" Media "Cage""."  Basically, the individual who suffers from this condition will spend all his time on the apps and never get to experience life since they prefer to make friends over the apps but never meet them. In my opinion,  social media is a double-edged  sword.  If it's used in the right way, social media helps people interact with each other;  however, it also can separate people by making them live by interacting only with their phones. 
Social media is considered one of the biggest and modern things that occurred in the world in the last century, and it can affect individuals and society in a positive or negative way, depending on the users and how they use it. Social media is playing a really important role in people's life because it has an effect on them and on the society. Some people are aware of how to use social media correctly and in a good way, like staying in touch with friends, family and colleagues; also, it's a good way to interact with new people and meet them in real life; all these things make the person and the society  be together and everyone know the others, which means it keeps them communicated to each other, and this can lead to good improvements in the society because everyone has good relationships, and everyone feels comfortable. As some people use the social media in a way that benefits them, like using it to make a business profile, this can increase the profits and lead to a successful society, where everyone uses social media in a strategy and a way that helps them to raise their money. However, there are also  negative and  bad effects of social media; one of them is the misuse of the applications for a bad reason, like collecting personal information about someone else and using it for personal things; this can make the person  feel low self-esteem, low  self-confidence and anxiety about what is happening to them; also, this affects the society because everyone will hate each other, and no development will occur for the society.
Social media is  one of the most important parts of an individual's life and is still growing at a rapid rate,  where it allows people to easily communicate with one another globally with a press of a button. Some people would say social media is ruining human interaction, and some people might agree with such a statement, but one cannot dismiss the fact that it made communication simple and so much easier. Websites such as Instagram, Twitter and even Facebook have contributed to making connections with people around the world and made communication with families, friends and loved ones an extremely easy task. Leaving the socializing part aside, social media has also contributed to corporates and companies  advertising and selling their goods through the Internet, and an important part of selling such items is through famous names. You would be surprised at the effect of endorsing a product through famous people; a single picture of an endorsed product next to a celebrity can change everything. In addition to that, big names can earn a considerably huge amount of money through endorsing a product or being an ambassador to some item, whether it was through pictures, blogs or even a podcast introducing the product to the public.
The effect of social media in the past decade Social media's popularity has increased over time. People use social media to communicate with one another and post pictures, videos and thoughts on their social media account. It has become so popular that it eventually became a part of our everyday life. Nowadays, you will always see people - more specifically teenagers and young adults - always facing their phone scrolling through social media sites. At this point, it has started to affect our lives as individuals and as a society. Firstly, as individuals, it has started to take many hours of our day. A study showed that people use social media from 2 to 3 hours a day, but if someone is really addicted, it can go up to 5 hours a day. Furthermore, using social media continuously will result in a habit, and it will eventually become an addiction; it will affect our mental and physical state. Using social media heavily can cause problems, such as depression, anxiety,  low self-esteem issues and constant tiredness. Secondly, as a society, social media has caused a lot of conflict and issues that did not exist before. Instead of its purpose of bringing us closer, it can divide a lot of people apart, and it will make our society disconnected and divided into groups. As a result of that, we will become aggressive and violent against one another; to solve this issue, we have to compromise on a solution to connect us all more, specifically in real life, because as much as there are good aspects of social media, we have to stay connected to the real world.
There was a huge growth in the usage of social media the past year, and it has affected the society in so many different ways. Nowadays, people can't escape social media - it's everywhere; people from the ages of 5 to 70 use social media, whether it's to update people  about their day or to influence a generation. However, the question is """How" did all of this affect us as a society and as "individuals?""" Many people have been affected by social media in very different ways. There are people that make a living out of submitting a post on Instagram to promote a product, and some people have gotten into a pit of insecurities due to all of the hate that is being sent to them. It depends on whom you ask, but as a society, it has affected us very positively; I believe it has created new ways of interactions, jobs and so many different things; it has made us stronger because of the amount of communication that is going on between individuals. It has created a new way of communication between the youth, adults, leaders, police officers, presidents and so many other people that it has become the best way to express injustice. However, with advantages,  there are disadvantages. There are negatives that come with social media; for example, when people send hate messages to others that are insecure people,  that leads to very unfortunate events. I do believe that we, as  society and individuals, have many ways to grow, and that does come with mistakes as well.
With modern-day  technology, social media has become a widescale form of communication between individuals. It allows people to connect with other parts of the world as well as catch up on the news and so much more. It is, however, much deeper than just the ways people talk on the Internet - it has an impact. What people choose to say or post can affect others, whether it is in a negative or positive way. Media coverage, for example, affects certain minorities, or even a whole group of people, if misleading information comes out to the public. What is said or done can have an impact on not just individuals but on societies as a whole. Whatever is posted on the Internet allows the reader to generate emotions, whether it is sadness, rage, happiness or even a sense of insecurity. That is why we need to worry about what we post and what we choose to make others believe or feel. Social media influencers - as they choose to call themselves - can, for example, post or do things online that affect the younger generations and, therefore, lead to them copying their actions. Some of those actions are not morally or ethically correct for their age group to perform, but because they have been brainwashed to believe it makes them cooler, they do it regardless. Some may argue that it is not what others post that affects individuals or societies, but rather, the person looking at the article or post themselves  chooses what to believe. That is, however, not within anyone's control. We cannot stop our emotions. In conclusion, social media affects our lives and our societies. That is why we need to be careful about what we post or write on the Internet because it can cause misunderstandings.
Social media is a tool used by many consumers in this day and age. People use it to communicate with a wide range of people from different countries and nationalities. Also, users can share their thoughts on social media and post pictures of food and beautiful places as well. There are numerous advantages and disadvantages that come from social media, and it has a huge effect on individuals in our society, especially in the 21st century. An advantage to social media is that people can post essays about certain issues to spread the word about them so they can be avoided. In addition, anyone can take a look at news around the world through a click of a button, unlike watching the news on TV. Moving on to the disadvantages, social media is a tool that can be used to send mean and hurtful messages to other users, which can cause them pain and distress. Furthermore, innocent people can get scammed by advertisements on social media, but that is a minor detail. Social media can affect individuals and our society; as individuals, we can communicate with others more freely and easily, but as I have mentioned earlier, it can lead to  cyberbullying. So people can get hurt due to the mean comments, and many of them can become depressed. In addition, the society can suffer from  cyberbullying, and it can become a very negative and judgmental society, which is a very bad thing; but if a society is built on honesty,  respect and many other virtues, social media will not be a huge issue. Overall, social media is used on a daily basis by many people and is a useful tool, but it can be harmful too.
Tolerance creates the society; it brings up a feeling that makes people feel valued and respected,  which helps them to feel wanted and brings the best in them.  Furthermore, we can promote tolerance by being a model for others by using positive comments and reinforcing their behavior; and also, trying to make them feel safe and special helps. Tolerance played a big role in the UAE from the day that all emirates got united. Most of the Emirati people are famous for generosity and tolerance because  our father, His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, installed in us the love of our country,  generosity and tolerance; and now, his son, His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan - may God protect him, is trying to go on his dad's steps to promote what his dad did to the whole world by naming 2019 the year of tolerance so all the people start doing projects and activities to promote the tolerance and to make people aware of it.
In society today, people all around the world are in contact with social media platforms. Societies and individuals using them are being affected by what they see or read, whether it is in a positive or a negative way. The effect of social media on individuals  easily occurs due to the fact of having famous people that persuade or have a huge effect on people that makes them do what they see on social media from the influencers they follow. An illustration of that is if a young girl sees an influencer she loves on social media buying something that is expensive that this girl cannot  afford, the girl would most probably keep begging her parents to buy it for her. The effect of social media on society is a bit different, where society most likely gets influenced by the news it sees and reads on social media that makes it think and act in some type of way. For example, in a society that is full of people that do not have full knowledge of a specific country, but what they see on social media about that country is all bad stuff  that is the image that they will keep in mind even though it is not the case. Overall,  social media can have many types of effects on individuals and society.
The UAE is home to many individuals of different cultures, faiths and nationalities, and like countries like the USA, the UK and   many more, it is  considered a multicultural society. In order for any country to be peacefully multicultural, tolerance and acceptance are vital; the UAE has been relatively successful in promoting an accepting society as campaigns like Year of Zayed and Year of Tolerance had a huge positive impact on locals and expats in the country. To further develop an  open-minded and welcoming community, the UAE can target the younger generation in schools and universities, thus helping young locals understand and explore other cultures' activities and celebrations; like Culture Day and language classes are some things schools can offer to students as a way to introduce them to different countries and their history, culture and language. The message of cultural tolerance can also be spread through social media to reach older audiences and locals. Like any other community, exposure to social media and communication with people around the world has helped the younger generation in becoming more open-minded as older generations could be less  open-minded because of the culture they were raised in; this may be the result of limited ways of communicating and learning about other countries and cultures. To solve this issue, public campaigns and classes can be offered to the older generations to give them a chance to learn about different societies.
Social media To begin with, a social media platform is an application that helps you interact with people from all over the world in a matter of seconds. Most of the applications are easily accessible due to today's technology since all that a person needs now is a simple working smartphone  or device that has access to the Internet. With almost every population across the planet using social media, the world is being impacted significantly in various forms - good and bad. With social media becoming a necessity, a person not using these applications is now considered restricted and uneducated. People share their lives on these platforms in many different ways, such as ranting on a personal blog about their problems or how their day has gone,  sharing a photograph of their families  on a vacation or recording videos of themselves practicing their hobbies. Believe it or not, social media is so essential to the point where many business companies might go bankrupt if they are not able to access social applications to advertise themselves. This can be used as an example of how the world has been affected by social media. Another example of society being heavily impacted by social media would be the fact that people are so addicted to their electronic devices that it is nearly impossible to find an average person spending less than an hour per day browsing or sharing through these modern programs. However,  determining if the effect social media has on individuals and society is good or bad depends on the usage itself. To illustrate, public speakers and politicians use social media to express their ideas and thoughts, which is very helpful for their careers. This can be thought of as a positive impact since social media aids these people to continue being successful. On the other hand, some people use social media to terrorize others and leak personal information in order to make illegal money or simply to experience the """pleasure""" that comes with the fear of their victims. This can be considered a negative impact caused by social media on people. Judging from the usage of the majority of people, social media has been mostly nothing but a modern way to help people communicate in a matter of seconds. Society and individuals have moved forward in technology and inventions due to the powerful impact social media platforms have had on people through the years. To summarize things up, social media applications are easily accessed due to today's technology. With such an effortless method, more and more people have begun to use them as they have become a necessity for your average person. These platforms  come with positive and negative effects on society and individuals, but they have been the start of a new era with inventors and technologists. With that being said, please be careful with how you represent yourself on social media - especially with strangers - and remember to use it in a positive way that might help you grow as a person.
Century 21 is about social media.   Nowadays, everyone uses social media because it communicates you to the world. For example, you have Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr. Using social media can be good and bad at the same time, but only you can decide how  you want to use it or how it will affect you and the society; you can use it to contact your family or your friend or to know what is new and what is trending; you can also meet new people from different countries, so you can learn about other cultures in a good way. On the other hand, social media can affect you and the society in a bad way; for example, someone can hack your profile and steal your information, like your bank account and your photos, to catfish people, or it can affect the society through someone who leaks information about the society or spreads a rumor that can change the society in a bad way. In the end, I think that everyone is responsible for their actions on social media so they do not affect  anybody in a bad way, so be careful,  respect others and do not be rude to anyone.
Looking back at how people used to live and communicate before social media makes one realize that this improvement isn't always positive. Social media has a great effect on individuals and society; it changed the way of living.   Nowadays, people sit together at family gatherings or friends' gatherings, and they barely communicate face to face - they're mostly on their phones. In my opinion, life before social media was way better; people actually socialized more, which is ironic because some people think social media made them more social, but this isn't true. They might have a lot of online friends and followers, but when it comes to reality, it's very different; most people are shy with their online friends, which means they won't meet them in real life, unlike actual friendships and the regular social life, where people know each other personally and not from behind a screen. Also,  cyberbullying is an issue that led to many suicide cases, and this will affect the society if it didn't do anything about it. I also think that social media stole the innocence of childhood; children   nowadays are not living their childhood the way we did. Their childhood is based on iPads and apps instead of messing around and playing outside with their neighbors.
Nowadays, technology is  a huge part of everyone's life. Social media took the first place all across the world; it is the fastest way to get easily in touch with others. This new way makes us socially active. In this essay, I will discuss how social media affects people individually in the society and the following generations. Social media is a group of ways to communicate with family or friends, such as Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter. It has some advantages and some disadvantages that may be effective in the society. Back in the day, reaching others wasn't easy as it is now, so these social applications are  a kind of development that is helpful. The most interesting part is that you can capture lovely moments and keep memories  alive forever. On the other hand, they affected all people by making us lose our emotional ways as well as our body language. In the society, they made a huge decrease in relationships all around. In conclusion, as the years go on, generations need to be aware of this bad habit, which is being addicted to social media. The better the protection the better; as we say so, we need to protect the world from the bad side of social media. We should excel for the sake of  humanity and  self-happiness.
Does social media have a big effect on individuals and society? Well, its effects could be negative and positive; the positive impact is that it increases communication, but it also leads to more hacking and network security problems, which are negative. In my opinion, social media has a big impact on individuals and society that could be either negative or positive. Social media has a huge positive impact on individuals and society, where it increases the communication; and  nowadays, it's so much easier to contact others even if they are far away;  moreover, social media is really useful when it comes to school, college and work because students and workers could search easily and find the information needed fast. Social media leads to a lot of problems, and it has many negative impacts on individuals and society; the reason is that it leads to hacking and security problems; and because of social media, it's hard to have your own privacy because it's easy for others to hack you; moreover, it's easy for individuals to contact strangers, which sometimes is really bad because people do not know those strangers, which might lead to danger for the individuals and the society. In conclusion, social media has both negative and positive effects on individuals and society; and to make social media useful, we need to use it in the right way and have good security systems.
Social media What is social media? How can it affect us personally? Will it affect the society as well? In this essay, we will discuss how  social media can affect  us, whether we can  stop the social media from spreading and finally, how we should  act and find solutions for this issue. Firstly, can social media  affect us and affect the society? In my opinion, the answer is yes. Personally, being on social media for hours can affect us mentally and physically; it can affect our health; for example, it decreases the power of the eyes and causes brain issues and other issues. Furthermore, social media can affect the society as well; for example, it spreads some racism and rumors about the people. Secondly, we can't stop social media from spreading; it is now the priority for most of the people. On the other hand, we can actually use the social media in a positive way rather than using it in a negative way; for instance, try to stop using social media a lot, stop spreading rumors, and act like a human being. Finally, the solutions are easy; for example, we have some lectures talking about the problems we are facing because of social media and how we should  stop it. Start asking others about their opinion of social media if it is really an issue. Moreover, there are many solutions to fix this issue. To sum up, your health and the society  depend on you; you must know how to use the social media carefully to stop this mess.
Social media is very important and common these days; it affects us in good and bad ways; if we knew how to use it in the right way, for sure, it will affect  us in a good way. Some of the common social media apps these days are Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, etc... In my opinion, social media affects  us in a very big way. As a person, while following and keeping up with the social media, I tried to concentrate on the advantages of it; I tried to search for the new ways of learning, and I followed people who can teach me other languages; it was so fun, and I didn't get bored. Moreover, I found an app that allows me to connect with people all around the world; I have a cousin who studies in the UK, and it was so hard for my family to contact him, but with this app, we can facetime him, and this is a good view of the social media. On the other hand, in this generation, there is no child without a cellphone or an iPad, so these kids can see some influencers on the social media and copy them. Well, the influencers are much older than them, and they do stuff that isn't appropriate for their age, the same as putting makeup or maybe smoking; kids can't do this stuff, so we can find out that here the social media affects  us in a bad way. The second example I gave can affect  our society; imagine that you are out somewhere and you see a  10-year-old  kid who smokes; how will you feel about it? Imagine if you saw a  12-year-old  girl who has shaved her eyebrows, wears lenses, has eyelashes on and wears  full makeup; believe me, you will feel awful seeing those kids not living their age. In conclusion, I think that if our society focused really on the rules of the social media, like the age and the content, they can post, and it will really help our society and us as   individual people.
In this paragraph, I am going to write about how  social media affects individuals and society and how to avoid  being a victim. Social media was a great invention because it helped people with their reports and many other things, just like it is easier to get the information you're looking for in a split   second instead of using a book or the whole library to get the information that you're searching for.  Social media helped in making the whole world a small city so that everyone  can communicate easily; instead of going to the person's   own place, you chat with him on any  social media applications and finish your work while you're lying on your bed and eating popcorn. However, there are a lot of advantages when it comes to using social media, but that doesn't mean that social media doesn't have a bad effect. Being addicted to social media is one of the horrible issues that can affect some people. Also, cybercrimes - and it's bad when kids become a victim of cybercrimes - affect an individual,   but for the society, it's more awful because it might give you the wrong information, and some of the information is untrusted.  Furthermore, there are so many people who discuss political issues, and that's what makes some trouble between a lot of countries. To avoid being a victim on social media, you should be careful about whom you're communicating with and change your password every month, and the stronger the password the better. Also, always check if the information you're looking for is 100% trusted; you can make a survey to be sure about it, and the adults should always check on children because some of them have no clue about cybercrime.
Social media can affect both individuals and societies in bad or good ways, but nowadays, it is important for us to communicate through it. Socialization through the social media can offer us the opportunity   to make new friends, trade new ideas and share some interesting content and pictures as well. Another way of getting a positive impact from the social media is that you could learn new cultures from people all around the world by getting to know them. Social media is a good way to advertise products if someone has opened a business and wants it to grow bigger quickly. Negative effects on the social media could isolate introvert people from the real world by ignoring everything around them. One of the most common effects is either online bullying or harassment; some sly people would target young girls, and that might cause them to fall prey to online attacks, which can create tension. Privacy is very important as well; revealing some information, as some users do so, can make them feel vulnerable and might lead to stalking too.
The UAE has witnessed a flourishing development in its economy and society in the past decade. In this essay, I will be discussing the most important developments in the UAE, both in technology and infrastructure. The UAE began as a deserted country with little to no means of transportation and buildings; in the coming years, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may he rest in peace, started the evolution of the UAE by discovering the oil, and then his children and the Al Maktoum family completed his mission - even after his passing and to this day - building the tallest tower in the world in Dubai, which was finished in 2009. The capital, Abu Dhabi, left no place for critics when they announced that the French Louver Museum will be opening its first branch in the Middle East and worldwide  as it was established in 2017. In addition to the economic development, the UAE went through an eco upgrade by making the first ever eco-friendly Masdar City in the Middle East. Masdar City is one of the most sustainable urban communities having wind turbines and solar panels to provide electricity; recycling, reusing and reducing waste is the master plan for Masdar City. To conclude, the UAE will continue to develop, but it never leaves its heritage and roots; while developing to meet the economical expectation, the UAE will also continue to provide eco-friendly substitutes and agricultural development. 
How does social media affect individuals and society? In this time and age, social media has become an important factor in our daily lives. From a  six-year-old  kid to  a 60-year-old man, most people seem to be addicted to it. Since social media has become what it is today, it has had many effects on individuals and society. When it was first introduced, it was a means to communicate with friends and family and to meet new people. Unfortunately, social media has taken a dark turn; nowadays, social media has become more of a weapon than a communication platform. It is used and abused by news channels to brainwash people or by politicians to impose their opinion. It also allowed people with no knowledge or experience in any given field to voice their opinion and talk about things they don't know about. Although there are some negative effects of social media, there are also some positive ones. For example, many people launch """hashtags""" to support a certain cause, and this has proven effective; the most recent example is that of the Amazon fire, when millions of social media activists urged governments to help stop the fire and men responded. Overall, social media has both negative and positive effects on both individuals and  society itself.
Social media has its own pros and cons, and it affects individuals and society in many ways. For society, it helps with improving business, politics, and many other sectors; it makes the community closer and creates a strong bond between countries, hence all people around the world are using it nowadays. We could learn new stuff about other cultures with one click, but sometimes, it can be a curse to society; for example, it adds fire to the wood; when there's a media war, it affects the counties' image when a person from a certain country talks badly about another country. For individuals, I think it depends on us; the ways we use social media  will get back to us; we can communicate and socialize with our families and friends so easily - all thanks to social media - and expand our knowledge about anything and everything; it also helps people keep   up-to-date with current technology; and the best thing about social media for me is that it helps people with disabilities  interact with each other, just like my little cousin does. On the other hand, it will maybe affect people in a negative way if they use it too much and not get enough sleep; some people use it to bully others and make their lives miserable, but as I said in the start, it depends on us.
Social media is  like apps that people connect,  chat together and even share things on.  Sometimes, it can be negative and positive, so individuals and society should be careful and know the rules of social media. The advantages that will affect   individuals and society are like sharing  positive things, being able to share thoughts together,  chatting online with family and friends, doing activities online and posting and advertising; social media even can be like a second job people gain money from  if they share things that are useful for the followers, and you'll even be able to manage your accounts. The disadvantages of the social media and the negative effects on individuals and society are so many; that's why you should be really strict on following the rules. No one wants trouble, so stay away from the negative points, like hacking accounts,  using others' ideas and information,  pretending to be someone else,  sharing bad stuff,  posting things that will cause you trouble,  saying rude comments on others' accounts on social media and being involved in sharing a variety of wrong and  non-true information. Always, on social media, be the good one because anyone can easily look at your accounts and judge you. Social media affects everyone who uses it, either in a good or a bad way; be careful when you  use it; you should use it in a good way and only take  advantage of it.
Social media Everything in this huge universe has pros and cons. It's the same thing  for social media. In my opinion, I see that it's all about the way that you are using it, so it's different from one person to another. However, one of the advantages of social media is keeping you updated.  You know the latest news and celebrity news with only one button, so I see that it's so useful for us. Anyways, if you stay for a long time on social media without doing anything else, surely it will affect you in a negative way, so if you control yourself and choose a time in the day you can browse or check your social media accounts, this way social media will not affect you negatively. If everybody does this, then the world will gradually  be a better place to live in because sitting for a long time on social media means that you won't be able to do something else; day by day, this will affect the society in many majors; it will affect your mental health also, and it's a very important element of a successful society. Anyways, if everyone has self-control, I am sure that we can do so many things for our community (The United Arab Emirates). Finally, I would like to say that I know so many people who are gifted, but it's all hidden behind sitting at home doing nothing and being lazy. We all have to collaborate to make the world or the community a better place to live in; show us your talent and do your hobbies in your free time instead of checking your accounts all the time. 
Social media has a big role in our lives; a lot of people, especially teenagers, sit on social media apps for hours. Social media has a lot of effects on people. First, the individual will be isolated. Second, the individual won't communicate with family members. Third and lastly, society won't work well together. First, people, or mostly teenagers, can get addicted to social media and sit on it for hours without feeling that time has passed. A lot of games are online now, for example, PUBG; people talk with each other while playing. Now,  a lot of countries have this competition between people playing social media trend games, and whoever wins gets a huge prize. Second, an individual will be isolated in his own bubble; he won't communicate with family members and friends. Most teenagers, for example, sit in their dark room with their phones and laptops, and they browse social media apps without knowing what is happening in the world or what is happening around them in their own house. Third and lastly, societies won't be able to work together if everyone is sitting on social media,  looking, stalking or following influencers. In order for a society to work together, it needs to communicate and work in groups. Society won't develop if all it does is sit and browse social media. In conclusion, social media harms the individual, and the individual will harm the society, so all of us should be careful about the way we use social media and not  become addicted to it.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Did you know that most of the people today cannot  live without using social media programs? This essay examines how  social media affects individuals and society. I believe that social media has two sides: a positive effect and a negative effect. First, this paragraph focuses on how social media affects individuals in a negative and positive way. Social media programs have made a lot of changes these days; they improved the individual's knowledge. For example, there are many accounts and bloggers that share a lot of good information about  different topics in a funny way, and when the user reads it or sees it, his knowledge increases,  and I saw that   myself. Furthermore, social media helps a lot of people in their projects and offers an easy way to earn money. For instance, a lot of Emirati families have started their own project, such as selling food,   homemade clothes and other items.  On the other hand, social media makes the individuals more insecure and antisocial. For example, a lot of people   nowadays do not like to hang out with their families or meet their friends in the real life;  they just hang out in the group chats, which makes their relationships weak. Second, this paragraph focuses on how social media affects the society. After the social media appeared, a lot of things in the society have changed. For instance, the way of shopping and ending your work in any company has become easier and faster; you can end all of this in just a few minutes because of social media programs. Also, social media programs affect negatively on the society. For example, the appearance has become the first thing in the society, which makes the people under pressure  always look good and luxurious, just to snap it and be a part of the social media society. To conclude, social media is a dangerous place that you have to use  wisely  and a very helpful place on the other hand.
The world we live in is a world of technology; we use it in our   day-to-day life. A part of this world is social media. It became so important that we cannot live without it, but we should recognize the positive and negative effects that social media platforms have on us. Social media became a huge part of our lives; we stay on our phones most of the day, just scrolling down social media; but do we know the effect it has on us? One of the positive effects on us is that it makes us closer to people. Through social media platforms, we can meet new people from all around the world, we can learn from them about their culture, and we can also teach them about ours, but if we become addicted to these social media platforms, it could destroy our lives. A negative effect of those platforms is the rumors and fake news that spread very quickly through them, and sadly, a lot of people believe those rumors, which can destroy the lives of others. That is why we should be careful when using social media so we don't fall in its deep black hole. In my opinion, social media platforms are really important in my life. Without them, I wouldn't be able to connect with my friends from around the world; but as a user of social media, I know its negative and positive impacts on me, and my society should know them too so it wouldn't turn into a badly influenced society.
Social media Nowadays,  phones  play a great role in our life. They are a hot potato. Some people think that is helpful, while others think that is harmful. In this topic, I am going to examine this question from both sides of view then give my own opinion. I believe that is a good way to connect with each other, and it's important to ease our life. Social media has  many advantages. Firstly, we can communicate with other people, such as family, friends and other countries. Secondly, we can save time; for example, if we search for some information, we can use the Wi-Fi that we call the Internet, so we don't use a  newspaper or a book. Thirdly, we can develop the country. However, the social media, or we can call it a small world in our hands, can give us a new major and also a new subject that we can learn  because all the people will be able to know everything and more things. It also has disadvantages. One negative illustrates that it makes the people lazy, and all the time they will sleep because if they want things, they can do them at  the same time. Secondly, it can affect negatively  our life; for example, it affects the eyes and makes us have a headache and be fat; this affects individuals and society. Finally, don't be with the family, just keep yourself alone,  don't chat with other people, only sit on the phone and do not do anything. To conclude, after having the merits and the demerits, we can see the good  and the bad way and how the phones can affect  our life. I personally think that  social media makes our life easy, and it affects positively  the individuals or society.
There are a lot of things that the United Arab Emirates is focusing on to improve itself and make itself,  but the most thing is the tourism;  there are many places and buildings that the government is trying to improve, and it made  new and unique things, like game parks, the highest buildings and also the services that the UAE offered to you.  However,  Dubai is the  place that tourists go to the most because there is everything that people need, from comfort to safety and luxury;  in addition,  Abu Dhabi (the capital of the UAE)  is building a new and fast way for traveling between the emirates - like a train, but in a more developed way - that will help the tourist to translate faster.  Also, the other emirates, like Sharjah, are the third way for tourists after Dubai and Abu Dhabi;  they have a traditional building and a specific thing for tourists that can help in a luxury way.  In addition, the UAE, in a general way, is trying to be in the next level of the development and a faster country;  they made a flying taxi,  flying cop and also a trip to space in 2020;  also, they are preparing for Expo 2020;  they will have millions of people from up to 150 countries that will come with an invention, and that will help to have a time leap of improvements and developments in all ways. 
Social media and its effects on society Nowadays, social media has taken over society. All members of society, whether they're young or old, can have access to the Internet. This has caused a huge change in society in the past ten years. People's interactions, habits and daily experiences have witnessed an enormous change. As social media applications, like Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, have grown bigger, they have been the most effective form of spreading awareness of the latest news of the community and its people. Even though social media can be convenient in this department, it can also be a source of problems for the majority of people. Social media is open and available to everybody. Some might argue about the issue in this case. Here, the problem is its over-accessibility. Children, teenagers and even the mentally ill can easily misuse these platforms by bullying others, blackmailing and other misconducts that are legally considered as  high-priority crimes. Parents might also argue that this wide-range accessibility leaves their children with screen addiction problems. Therefore, social media also affects family bonds. The spread of these multi-million social media platforms may have started for a good cause. However, we tend to over-rely, which is where the problem starts.
Tolerance in the UAE The UAE supports good behavior and encourages it; tolerance is the 2019 title in the UAE. The UAE is right now working on growing this culture into its people. The new generation has been taught in school to be tolerant,  try to understand other cultures and traditions and try to accept them cause that is what tolerance is  about. First, tolerance is a big part of our life; because of the variety of people, there are different cultures, traditions and religions, so to accept them and go with them are  what tolerance is about. Making tolerance a part of our community will not only make people understand, but will also make them kind and polite, which will lower the war chance. Second, to grow tolerance in our community, it has to be taught in schools and small communities; also, it has to be taught to parents so children can learn it faster. We have to value tolerance because of its big benefit back to us, the humans. In the end, tolerance will prevent big tragedies and problems, like big wars or even civil wars; it will make people good to each other, and they will be able to live happily with each other with love and acceptance.
Social media Social media has a huge effect on the individual themself, and it could be a bad or good influence; it depends on how you use it and what sector you are in. Social media could be used for work, education, hospitals, socializing and contacting with  other people; it has more benefits than  downsides. You can develop your skills via social media by following teaching accounts, such as language, cooking, makeup tutorials or whatever hobby you like. Also, social media is considered as a work that you can seek  a job on; for example, if you are an employee in a specific company, you can serve the customer by contacting or replying to customers (on the company's Twitter, Instagram or any other social media accounts) that  need help but cannot  go to the company. Also, social media could be dangerous if you did not use it in the right way; you have to be secure and not tell anyone your personal information so they cannot  hack your accounts,  pictures  or privacy. Social media could end many lives when teenagers or any person  gets bullied on social media; when they get comments on their posts, negative and bad words, like """You" look "ugly!"","  """You" are "fat""" or similar words that lead them to feel bad about  theirselves,  they could commit suicide. Technology and social media can improve many skills and services - whether it affects the individual themself or the whole society - if they use it in the right way and not the opposite. People should be informed of what they will face if they use it in the wrong way so they can be careful.
Today, the term social media is all over the place. It's really rare to find someone who doesn't use social media. Children use it to watch cartoons on YouTube. Teenagers and adults use it to check for information and chat with their friends and relatives who may be in a different country. Social media has its pros and cons, which I will present in this essay. Social media is an isolated digital world that has somehow made life easier. You would ask, """How" has it made life "easier?""" Well, the process of gathering information for tasks is so much easier. You can access any information you need with a click of a button, which saves time and effort. Another thing is that it made it a lot  easier to communicate, such as checking up on a family member who is 50 kilometers away and chatting with friends by a message or even a video call. However, social media also has its bad side. Cyberbullying is becoming a new common word, which tells a lot about the bad side of social media. It means that when people tend to bully others online, this causes a lot of damage to the victim mentally and may lead to physical problems and also to committing suicide. To conclude, social media has its good and bad sides. I really think that it depends on the person who is using it; if the person is using it for getting information, he will see the good side, and that it is useful, and if he's using it to bully, it means that he's on the dark side of it.
The effects of social media Nowadays, everyone uses social media, from children to elders; it is very common. We use it for fun, to communicate with others and to know what is going on in the world. I'm here to talk about its effect on individuals and society. First, individuals are part of society, so let's begin with them and see the effects. Individuals take around 8-9 hours a day on social media, which will lead them to  eye issues; they will need to wear glasses later on. Moreover, everything they hear or see, they share  even if it is fake; this will make people believe everything that they hear or see. The children are the ones who will be affected the most; their families do not watch what they are watching or hearing; maybe they will learn bad things or even share something bad. Second, after talking about individuals, we can now talk about the society. Things are easy to move from one person to another, so this will make some people hate each other. Furthermore, the society will be lazy; I mean that they will work less because their time is on social media, watching what people do. To sum up, in my opinion, social media is important to know what is happening, but let us reduce the hours of using it  and work hard to make our country successful and better.
Social media is a variety of platforms that aid in communication between users through the Internet, and it can come in many forms. The most common social media platforms being used are Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat, and YouTube. On all these social media platforms, there are famous influencers. Influencers are basically people who use their platform to promote and influence others. Now, these influencers can do many things to affect society and its individuals, and one of them is spreading positivity or even negativity. An influencer can help society by promoting good things to their viewers. For example, if an influencer raises money from his or her viewers to give to charity, this can help people think more about people who have less than they do. Social media also promotes sharing your thoughts and opinions online, and many can have a tremendous amount of impact on society. In addition to this, growing your followers on social media helps the influencer in expanding their goals and becoming entrepreneurs, which means more jobs, which leads to a better economy. Social media also has a negative impact as does everything else in life. When used by the wrong people, social media can be a horrible place. A common example is  cyberbullying, which impacts thousands of people online. Another example is predators who prey on young teens to send inappropriate stuff to them. In conclusion, social media has its fair share of positive and negative things, and people should be careful about how they decide to use it because you never know what those actions will result in.
Social media nowadays is considered a hugely effective platform that both individuals and society can benefit from if it is used in the right way.  In 2019, the effect of social media to some extent can be better than governmental officials.  How can social media have this powerful effect? Well, first of all, social media will help individuals to share their culture and the way they live and bring individuals closer together.  Secondly, individuals can share their own thoughts and ideas without the fear of getting arrested in some countries that consider  """freedom" of "speech"""  illegal.  Thirdly, social media can be a way to help other people and raise their voice,  for example, the  movement, where it exposed the Sudan government, and how they tortured the protesting civilians in order to stop the protest.  Therefore, all those effects on individuals will have a huge impact on the society we live in.  It can raise awareness and build a strong society that respects every individual.  However, in the other hand, social media can have a bad effect on individuals and society,  where it can be used by everyone, and it does not have boundaries or limits;  for instance,  it can be used by sex traffickers in order to attract their victims,  which will result in  fear in the society and among the individuals.  Everything and everyone has two sides: a good one and a bad one.  Therefore,  if social media was used in a good way, it will have a huge effect on our world, and it will result in a flourishing society and strong individuals.
