social media has a negative effects and a positive effect in our lifes, 95% of kids use social media in there life more than sitting with there  familys,moreover social media side effects  that people is too lazy to use there brain ,genrally social media has a good habit that half of our shoppings is online and by instgram and those stuff.as  i see social media is too imporatnt to me i can read online books  ,shop online,but  our problem is how it affects our society,our  new genration cant depends on there self because the whole world is supporting social media,it  effects on our familys the most becuase family gatherings is now under the title of set in silent, why becuase all of them are using there mobile phones and its a bad habbite it will effect our traditional ways of sitting with our grandmothers. as i see people have to contral there usings for social media to have more time with there kids.
Social media affect to the pepole in work and thy take her tima and beaing lazy at studing thy canit foucas at studying.Also  social media  effecting    to  society thy have positiv and netigav ways,positiv things  its we can connect with other pepole and country thats esay ways, and we can get more informaiton to learning at studing.overall  the negativ ways   its take tima from the pepole and the family or frinds beaing alone also  can it meet withe other like gathering becuse every one busay withe her phone.so  that big proplems it is  mayby som hackrs still you informaithn when you sheart in  you social media .Fainly i think  should be caerfull and do not using you phon  more than 5 hours in one day thats for you health and your boody.
I think that now the social media is effect the whole word not just  spisific erea.for   last century or if i want to be spicific  last 10  years,everyone in the world should have accounts in any application coming new like :snapchat,instegram  and facebook . no one can cuntinue the day with out just looking for any application and see the updates and this effect  person in his life and work.The  life now has no privacy bacause now people they share everything for people in another place for example they share where did they   go,eat and what they boat.on  the another hand people also follow the bloggers and famous persons in social media. Like an artist singer or blogger and they follow the daily life for them . Then they came jalous about they life and they wis the same life for them and they start to find any thing they do it to reach money and have a rich life with out carinng if it is  bad or good way .People also can find a wife or husbund from social media.social  media can cause problems beetween the family and friends ,for example if they see some one go uot without telling them they get mad and angry and it is a bad effect for society
In my opinion I think that the most important developments in the uae naw are the people how live in it and the government . They are  most important becouse they can improve their country, also they have a royaliti for uae . Fourthermore, uae  government do all  things that can help their people and sapport thim and gives thim pawer to show the world what they can do as a people how development many thing in thier country , by helping each ather . Also i think im one of these people , im as a student i can develop my self and my country haw? i can do it by stading hard and woork hard to help my government and my country. i whant to become a verey important person and have my  onwork after my government , also we should to put aour contry btween different countres in the world and show that we have the most important developments at the moment , and all  that  thinhs for uae  people and uae  government . so we are think gad and selfs to have all this thing in auer lifes . im so brawed of me self and my country so think you me government and people .

Social media have a two side one of them are good for us but the another said make our life crazy. Today I will write  How do social media affect people and society? First of all, social media can help us by texting our friend and family in any time. For example, If you  out of the country and you want to see your family you can call thim by video so you can see thim in the same time. I think it's good for us but a lot of people didn't know that's  had a lot of problem to our life. In another hand, social media can affect our life in  nigative side. For example, There are a lot of hacks, so they can go in your phone and take all of the information that in side the phone and use it in the bad way. Such as, the can take of your privet photos and ask for money to deilet them. To sum up, we mast take care about our devises because there are a lot of hacks that hack our phone or divises. In my opinion, we must use the social media in the right way to protect our life, alos  may be a company that kill all the hacks in our life to save social media.
Social media is about communecate with each other in phones . some of the people think it is  bad idea to be all  time in social media , in  other hand little of people prefer to use it . Social media affect a lot of good and bad things such as many of people can they know all  news and what  happen in the country or anywhere but some time these news it can be false . In social media all people can talk about a lot of things and talk about his opinion . Some time people in social media effects society and they make a mess between countries . In my opinion social media is effects in individuals and society in good things more then the bad things .
Social Media Has evolved termendously throughout the years and became one of the essentials in an individual's life which they can't live without,People  spend most of their time using social media whether it is to waste time,  get to know people or culture from around the world,There  are a variety of social media Platforms that people can use such as   Facebook,Twitter,Instagram,Telegram  etc. Social media affects people greatly  whether its an positive or negative effect  depending on how they use it on  daily basis, There are people who get addicted to socialmedia  to the extent where they drop all the necessary stuff they should do or care about   like:Work,Family,Friends and  get immersed in social media and live in  virtual life to forget their Real life Hardships  whether it's a bad job,a   failed marriage  or to get temporarly away from life. Social media can also save people  alot of  time that they could have taken hours ,People get to know people around the world,Run  everyday errands easily, Buy things without having to go outside,Text  family and friends everyday,make    scheduales that are efficent and easier to use for  daily basis.
As we all know everything now a days is a technological base, and most of use uses social media to communicate with others and to to know what happens all around the world. Everything has its positive and negative side so if we started thinking about how social media contributed  or affected our society we will find tuns of positive and negative out comes. As an example social media made communication much easier so distance wont be a significant barrier between family and friends. As well as  being  able to keep up with all  things that  happening all around the world. One of the negative effects  that social media is an on-line based application so it consumes a lot of energy which is the inter-net especially electricity and that is conducted from the trees in addition it contributes in global worming. Social media is the easiest way of communication.Most  of the humman beings use social media to interact with each other. As an example I personally use social media to communicate with my friends that are studying abroad. I keep up with them since we are living in different places and countries. Family's that migrated from their countries use it as a way to see their beloved  through out social media. In addition it made communication with new people no longer an issue.  Internet, technology and social media is helping in causing global worming. Electricity is a main form of energy and  internet uses electricity as  power source. The elecrticty that is used is conducted from trees and causes CO2 to be spreded more often that helps in destroying the atmosopher layer. In the conclusion, social media has its advantages and disadvantages. People may agree thats  the best way of comunicatingm  and infulincing others and some will disagree. Everyone chooses the way that they use it
Question c) How do social media affect individuals and society? These days all the people from around the world use social media as there primary source of which they get information and news from but  are they really that accurate and trusted. the answer would basically be no because they use a wide variety of techniques for you to just click on it  this is called a clickbait. its when the title says something completely different from what is really being told in the passage itself. this completely affects the society. there may be some advantages and disadvantages in this type of title for example people can go on youtube and get help and suggestions if they have any problems at doing something particular. they also use social media for business related stuff and training websites for online courses. the disadvantages that could happen  is you concentrate on all the information that is being spread all around social media and you forget to watch the tv news like  new york times and etc, you also affect the community thats is around you and share false information that could lead to terrible pathways. i really would recommend a second choice when it comes to daily news and make sure of the information you have is reliable and correct before you start to spread rumors.
What do you think our lives will be  without the existence of social media ? Social media has an enormous impact in all socities , every person alive uses social media now a days , all genders and ages. Social media can affect us negatively and positively in our daily lives. Social media is the most entertainment online applications that existes now. Fisrt of all, people can get  advantage from it in many ways, they can collect new important information from any of these applications , meet new people in social media ( online) , chat with their friends and relatives and so on. Social media made people's life easier they can reach anyone by these applications , like whatsapp , instagram , snapchat and etc. Social media helps people to read more and do many activities online, people can share their daily lives routine and it gives us a chance to open our minds and think wisely through what we've been watching and collecting online. Otherwise social media affects people in a negative way. Rumors are everywhere espically in social media  there are  alot of them , and people start to accept these rumors although they're completely wrong. Social media sometimes lead people to a wrong path, they uses false information for example of something that has happened before in their region or country. Social media can distracts students from studying and working hard , they just sit and hold their phones or laptops so they check their applications if they had any notifications in it. Using social media  alot leads to mental health  sometimes , the screens have electrones and these electrones might affect our eyes and they might get red and tired from the long time usage. Moreover social media can lead us to stop thinking out of the box and just rely on the information given in the applications. In a conclusion , my opinion is to use social media and entertain yourself but dont use it for a long time so you dont get affected negatively.
question: how do social media affect individuals and society? At the begining the social media is not something new for this generation, it's just going to be new for the older people that they don't know exactly what's social media is? Social media have the advantages and dis-advantages of every thing that happens in the social media. the social media effects the indiviuals more than the society, as an example of indiviuals they may use the social media in the wrong way, which sometimes they get hurt of the people behind the screens that are using social media. Their parents need to know about the children and  waht are they using it. In addition, it also harms the society, from the people where are they living they get so many bad things        it's either about their country or the way of their parents are rising them up. Furthermore, it also effects the children who are right now in the age of 5 or 6 years, which they play bad video games and other people in  other side that they play with will say some bad words, and the kids will learn them and use them in their usual days. It bad which also they should put  redlines to which  age are using what and  they are speaking to who or even playing.  Because now these days even the children their age  5 and above to 14 years old they use bad words that in the old generation they didn't even have the right to say it. But every singleone  should take the responsibilities of what they are doing.
 Loved the last topic because it does affect   alot,there is many of reasons why and how does it effect on society,  first reason is  pepole  all over the social media so it is a good way for it when your always on social  with time it does effect on society even when not all  on  media pepole will mention it and tell pepole about  it,there  is alot of positive and negative of it every thing in life has both sides like it is positive that pepole will now more information and it will develop in , its negative because problemsd may hapen which does affect becase it may not go with our culture it is an all over the world we dont exept that but it will help more  than just dosent it does depend on  the person how he would use it and  hes thinking of it pepole should get better in it becase it will help  alot, it may affect on changing the society in good or bad  you must make it in a way,good ways like selling things that pepole would need or talking about good topics like making pepole will make them stronger and felling better or something that could help in studing and  goals,bad   thing  that it may affect on pepole by the way they with all of the prefection in social madia and some by letting them feel bad or just using it with no good resons it wiil make your thinking would change parents dont like  but i think it is a good thing because you will now better and new information  that is what i think.
social media Nowdays people are so effected by the social media as we can see , if not all of us its most of us , personally i think it depends on how we use it , it is positive way or  we are using it to waste our whole day. social media helped us to contact easily with others additionally we can contact anyone form all around the world , means  it makes our life easier , also there's  a lot of things that we can learn there , like you can read online books , and its such an easy way to get an information from , and there's   alot of helpful way to do your business , and to advertise fot it. In the other hand social media can effect others in a nigative way , wich   people spends hours on social media and ignore their tasks , and spend a whole day doing nothing and just being in socail media . A lot of people use it to bully others in social media wich it can effect so much on the person who get bullied , plus a lot of people now share their personal informations publicly wich  they will have to face an identity theft. Finally as i mentioned it depends on how you choose to spend your time , and depends on how you use social media , my advice is  to not get addicted to these applications a lot cause it might effect you in a bad way , use it just for  few time not the whole day.
how does the social media affect indiveduals and society? i believe that social media has both good and bad traits, it could help a person in so many ways,for  example if the person was out of the country and wants to communicate with their family or have to finish some surtain job, it will be easier. and  dont have to worry that they should be back , or about the traffic and more. The affect of social media , there are kids who have social media accounts it could be dangerous in some ways they could reply to strangers and it could end up in a bad setuation. And we cant forget about the online bullying and how  can it affect one another and the power of social media   if they dislike a person they could ture most of the people ageinst them , and telling them to go commit suicide and more which is not healthy. because of social media people dont know how to communicate with others they prefer to stare at their mobiles for hours than to socialize. people are scared to get out and to talk to people , because most of their lives depends on it . they cant leave their phone its like its    apart of them which is unhealthy .and now it became that what ever you do you should impress the people that are following you for example what do you wear  who  are you friends with its  like your business is theirs too . I believe that they should have a day  every month or week  which they spend it with their loved ones , and away from the internet.
Nowadays social media became a foundation to our lives.No  one can live without using  atleast one of the apps provided , they are the key to starting relationships and stay in contact with you friends,families  and your loves ones .Many people find a big challenge in meeting others and make fiends.Social  media is a great way to help them ovecome their fears and help them become more social and interact with the society in many diffrent ways.Each  app has its own distinctive way , now an individual can bassially be everywhere from his home , some apps allow texting and others allow video chatting .Either way they help those poeple that live in fear of meeting new people in on way or another by interacting with them from a place where they feel completly safe and secure.On  the other hand , some people develope a condition called """" social media cage """" basically the individual whom suffers from this condition will spend all his time on the apps and never get to experience life since they prefer to make friends over the apps but never meet them.In  my opinion , scial media is a double edged sword . If its used in the right way social media helps people interact with each other , however it also can seperate poeple by making them live by interacting only by their phones .
Social media is consider one of the biggest and modren things that occurs in the world in the last centrey, and it can effect individual and society in a positive or negative ways depends on the users and how they use it. Social media is playing a real important role in people life because it has an affect to them and to the society. Some people are awear of how to use social media correctely and in a good way like staying  touch with friends, family and collegeous, also, it a good way to interacte with new people and meet them in real life all these things make the person and the society to be togather and everyone knows the others which mean to keep them communicated to each others and this can lead to good improvemnents in the society because everyone have good relationships and everyone feel comfortable .As some people use the social media in a way that benefit them like use it to make a bussiness profile this can increase the profits and lead to a successful society where everyone use social media in a stratogye and a way that help them to rise their money. However, there are also a negative and a bad effects in socail media one of them is  misuse of the applications for a bad reason like collecting personal information about someone else and used  for personal things this can make the person to feel low self-esteem, low self confidence and anixety to what is happening to them also this effect the society because everyone will hate each other and no develpoment will occurs for the society.
Social media is a one of the most important parts of an individual's life, and is still growing at a rapid rate, in which it allows people to easily communicate with one another, globally, within a press of a button. Some people would say social media is ruining human interaction, and some people might agree with such  statement, but one cannot dismiss the fact that it made communication simple and so much easier. Websites such as instagram, Twitter and even facebook have contributed to making connections with people around the world, and made communcation with families, friends and loved ones an extremely easy task. Leaving the socializing part aside, social media has also contributed for corporates and companies to advertise and sell their goods through the internet, and an important part of selling such items is through famous names. You would be surprised at the effect of endorsing a product through famous people, a single picture of an endorsed product next to  celebrity can change everything. In addition to that, big names can earn a considerably huge amount of money through endorsing a product, or being an ambassador to said item, whether it was through pictures, blogs, or even a podcast introduing the product to the public.
The effect of social media In the past decade, social media's popularity has increased over time. People use social media to communicate with one another and post pictures, videos,  thoughts to their social media account. It has become so popular that it eventually became a part of our everyday life. Nowadays you will always see people,  more specifically teenagers and young adults  always facing their phone scrolling through social media sites. At this point it has started to affect our lives as individuals and as a society. Firstly, as individuals it has started to take many hours of our day. a study showed that people use social media from 2 to 3 hours a day. But if someone is really addicted it can go  to 5 hours a day. Furthermore, using social media continuesly will result into a habit and it will eventually become an addiction. it will effect our mental and physical state.using  social media heavily can cause problems such as depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem issues and constant tiredness. Secondly, as a society social media has caused a lot of conflict and issues that did not exist before. Instead of it's purpose of bringing us closer, it can divide a lot of people apart. And it will make our society disconnected and divided into groups. As a result of that we will become aggressive and violent against one another. to solve this issue, we have to compromise on a solve to connect us all more. specifically in real life. because as much as there is good aspects of social media, we have to stay connected to the real world.
There is a huge growth in the usage of social media the past year, and it has effected the society in so many different ways. Nowadays people can't escape social media;  it's everywhere, people from the ages of 5 to 70 use social media, weather it's to update people people about their day or to influence a generation. Although the question is, how did all of this affect us;as  a society and as individuals. Many people have been affected by social media in very different ways, there are people that make a living out of submitting a post on Instagram to promote a product, and some people have got into a pit of insecurities due to all of the hate that is being sent to them. It depends on who you ask, but as a society it has affected us very positively I believe, it has created new ways of interactions, jobs, and so many different things, it has made us stronger because of the amount of communication that is going on between individuals. It has created a new way of communication between the youth, adults, leaders, police officers, presidents, and so many other people that is has become the best way to express injustice. However with advantages , their are disadvantages. There are negatives that come with social media, for example, when people send hate messages to others that are insecure people, and that leads to very unfortunate events. I do believe that we as a society and individuals have many ways to grow, and that does come with mistakes as well.
With modern day technology social media has become a widescale form of communication between individuals. It allows people to connect with other parts of the world as well as catch up on the news and so much more. It is, however, much deeper than just  ways people talk on the internet,  it has an impact. What people choose to say or post can affect others weather it be in a negative or postive way. Media coverage, for example, affects certain minorities or even a whole group of people if misleading information comes out to the public. What is said or done can have an impact on not just individuals but on societies as a whole. Whatever is posted on the internet allows the reader to generate emotions weather it be sadness, rage, happiness or even a sense of insecurity. That is why we need to wary of what we post and what we choose to make others believe or feel. Social media influencers,  as they choose to call themselves,  can for example post or do things online that affect the younger generations and therefore leads to them copying their actions. Some of those actions are not morally or ethically correct for their age group to perform but because they have been brainwashed to believe it makes them cooler they do it regardless. Some may argue that it is not what others post that affect individuals or societies but rather the person looking at the article or post themselves that chooses what to believe. That is, however, not within anyones control. We cannot stop our emotions. In conclusion, social media affects our lives and our societies. That is why we need to be careful of what  post or write on the internet because it can cause misunderstandings.
Social media is a tool used by many consumers in this day and age. People use it to communicate with a wide range of people from different countries and nationalities. Also, users can share their thoughts on social media,  post picture's of food and beautiful places as well. There are numerous advantages and disadvantages that come from social media, and it has a huge effect on individuals in our society, especially in the 21st century. An advantage to social media is that people can post essays about certain issues to spread  word about them, so they can be avoided. In addition, anyone can take a look at news around the world through a click of a button, unlike watching the news on TV. Moving on to the disadvantages, social media is a tool that can be used to send mean and hurtful messages to other users which can cause them pain and distress. Furthermore, innocent people can get scammed by advertisements in social media, but that is a minor detail. Social media can affect individuals and our society, as individuals  can communicate with others more freely and easily, but as I have mentioned earlier, it can lead to cyber bullying. So, people can get hurt due to the mean comments and many of them can become depressed. In addition, the society can suffer through cyber bullying and it can become a very negative and judjemental society, which is a very bad thing. But if a society is built on honesty and respect and many other virtues social media will not be a huge issue. Overall, social media is used on a daily basis by many people and is a useful tool, but  can be harmful too.
tolerance creat the society it brings up a feeling that makes people feel valued and respected , which helps them to feel wanted and bring the best in their selfs, Furthermore, We can promote tolerance by being a model for others by useing positive comments and reforce their behavior and also try to make them feel safe and special helps. tolerance played a big rule in the UAE from the day that all emarites got united, most of  emaratie people are famous with generosity and tolerance because of our father His Highness Shaikh zayed bin sultan al nahyan installed in us the love of our country and generosity and tolerance and now his son His Highness Shaikh khalifa bin zayed bin sultan al nayhan  may god protect him  trying to go on his dad steps to promote what his dad did to the whole world by naming 2019 the year of tolerance so all the people start doing project and activities to promote the tolerance and to make people aware of it
In society today, people all around the world are in contact with social media platforms. Societies and individuals using them are being effected by what they see or read whether it is in a positive or a negative way.  Affect of social media on individuals is easily occuring, due to the fact of having famous people that persude or has a huge affect on people that makes them do what they see on social media by the influencers they follow. An illistration to,   if a young girl sees a influencer she loves on social media buying something that is expensive that this girl can not afford, the girl would most probably keep begging her parents to buy it for her. The affect of social media in society is a bit different, where society most likely gets influenced from the news they see and read in social media that makes them think and act  some type of way. For example, in  society that is full of people that do not have full knowledge of a specific country, but what they see in social media about that country is all bad stuff, then that is the image that they will keep in mind even though it is not that case. Over all social media can have many types of affects on individuals and society.
The UAE is home to many individuals of different cultures ,faiths and nationaltys and like countrys like the   usa and uk and many more  they are considered  multi-culturel society.  Inorder for any country to be peacfully multi-culturel tolerance and exeptance are vaitle, the uae has been relitivley successfull in promoteing an exepting sociaty as campagins like year of zayed and year of tolerance had a huge positve impact  locals and expats in the country. To further develop a open minded and welcoming community the uae can target the younger generation in schools and universitys thus help young locals understand and explore other cultures, activates and celebraitions like culture day and language classes are some things schools can offer to students as a way to introduce them to differents countrys and their history, culture and language. the message of culture tolerance can also he spread through social media to reach older audiances and locals. like any other community exposure to social media and communication with people around the world has helped the younger generation in becomeing more open-minded as older generations could be less open minded because of the culture they were raised in, this may be the result of limited ways of communicating and learning about other countrys and cultures. to solve this issue public campains and classes can be offerd for the older generations to give them a chance to learn about different societys.
Social Media To begin with, a social media platform is an application that helps you interact with people from all over the world in a matter of seconds. Most of the applications are easily accessible due to today's technology, since all what a person needs now is a simple working smart phone or device that has access to the internet. With almost every population across the planet using social media, the world is being impacted significantly in various forms,  good and bad. With social media becoming a necessity, a person not using these applications is now considered restricted and uneducated. People share their lives with these platforms in many different ways, such as ranting on a personal blog about their problems or how their day has went, or sharing a photography of their families out on a vacation, or recording videos of themselves practicing their hobbies. Believe it or not, social media is so essential to the point where many business companies might go bankrupt if they are not able to access social applications to advertise themselves. This can be used as an example of how the world has been affected by social media. Another example of society being heavily impacted by social media would be the fact that people are so addicted to their electronic devices, that it is nearly impossible to find an average person spending less than an hour per day browsing or sharing through these modern programs. However, to determine if the effect social media has on individuals and society is good or bad depends on the usage itself. To illustrate, public speakers and politicians use social media to express their ideals and thoughts, which is very helpful for their careers. This can be thought  as a positive impact since social media aids these people to continue being successful. On the other hand, some people use social media to terrorize others and leak personal information in order to make illegal money, or simply to experience the """pleasure""" that comes with the fear of their victims. This can be considered a negative impact caused by social media on people. Judging from the usuage of the majority of people, social media has been mostly nothing but a modern way to help people communicate in a matter of seconds. Society and individuals have moved forward in technology and inventions due to the powerful impact social media platforms have had on people through the years. To summirize things up, social media applications are easily accessed due to today's technology. With such an effortless method, more and more people have begun to use them as they have become a necessity for your average person. These platforms have come with positive and negative effects on society and individuals, but they have been the start of a new era with inventors and technologists. With that being said, please be careful with how you represent yourself on social media - especially with strangers - and remember to use it in a positive way that might help you grow as a person.
Centry 21 is about social media, Now a days everyone use social media because it comunicate you to the world, For example you have  Twitter,Instagram and Tumblr. Using social media can be good and bad at the same time but only you can decied how do you want to use  or how it will affect you and the society, you can use  to contact you family or your friend or to now what is new and what is trending, you can also meet new people from diffrent countries so  can learn about other culture in a good way. On the other hand social media can affect you and the society in a bad way, for example someone can hack your profile and steal your information like your bank account and you photos to catfish people or it can affect the society by someone who leak information about the society or spread a roummer that can change the society in a bad way. In the end i think that everyone is responseble about their action in social media so they do not affect any body in a bad way so be carefule and repect others and do not be rude to anyone
Looking back at how people used to live and communicate before social media makes one realize that this improvement isn't always posative. Social media has a great affect on individuals and society, it changed the way of living. Now a days people sit together at family gatherings or friend gatherings and they balrey communicate face to face,  they're moslty on their phones. In my opinion, life before social media was way better poeple actually socialzed more which is ironic because some people think social media made them more social but this isn't true. They might have  alot of online friends and followers but when it comes to reality it's very different, most people are shy from they're online friends which means they won't meet them in real life. Unlike actual friendships and the regualr social life,  people know each other personally and not from  a screen. Also cyber bullying is an issue that led to many succide cases, and this  affects the society if they didn't do anything about it. I also think that social media stole the innocence of childhood, childeren now a days are not living they're childhood the way we did. They're childhood is based on ipads and apps instead of messing around and playing outside with they're neighbors.
Nowadays technology has been a huge part of everyones life. Social media took the first place all across the world, it is the fastest way to get easily in touch with others.

Social media is  group of ways to communicate with family or friends, such as Instagram, Snapchat and twitter. It has some advantages and some disadvantages that may be affectable in the sociaty. Back in the day reaching others wasn't easy as it is now so these social applications were such a kind of development which is helpful. The most intresting part is that you can capture lovely momments and keep memories a live forever. On the other hand they affected each people by making us loose our emotional ways as well as our body language. In the sociaty they made a huge decreace in realationships all around. In conclution, by the years go on generations need to be aware from this bad habbit which is being adictied to social media. The best  protection, the better as we say so we need to protect the world from the bad side of social media. We should excel for the sake of the huminity and self happiness.

Firstly, is social meddia can affect us and affect the society? in my opinion, the answer is yes, personaly being in socail media for hours can affect us mentally and pysichaly, it can affect our health such as:  dicreasing the power of the eyes,   brain issues and others.  Furthermore, social media can affect the society as well such as:  spread some racisums and rumours around the people. Secondaly, we cant stop social media from spreading it is now the priority for most of the people.

Social Media is very important and common these days, it affect us in good and bad ways, if we knew how to use it in the right way for sure it will affect on us in a good way. Some of the common social media apps these days are  snapchat,instagram,facebook  etc.. In my opinion social media affect on us in a very big way, As a person while following and keeping up with the social media I tried to concetrate on the advantages of it, I tried to search for the new ways of learning,  I followed people who can teach me other languages, it was so fun and I didn't get bored. moreover I found an app that allows me to connect with people all around the world, I have a cousin who studies in the UK and it was so hard for my family to contact him but with this app we can facetime him and this is a good view of the social media. On the other hand, in this generation there is no child without a cellphone or an Ipad, so these kids can see some influencers on the social media and copy them, well the influencers are much older than them and they do stuff that is'nt appropriate to there age,  same as putting makeup or maybe smoking, kids can't do these stuffs, so we can find out that here the social media affect on us in a bad way. The second example I gave can affect on our society, immagine that you are out somewhere and you see a 10 years old kid who smokes, how will you feel about it? Immagine if you saw a 12 years old girl who have shaved her eyebrows, wears lences, have eyelashes on and wears a full makeup, bellive me you will feel awfull seeing those kids not living their age. In conclusion I think that if our society focused really on the rules of the social media like the age and the conntenet they can post  it will really help our society and  as an a indivisaul person.
In this paragraph I am going to write abot how do social media affect individuals and society and how to avoid from being a victim. social media was a great invent because it helped people on their reports and many other things just like it is esaier to get the information you're looking for in a split of a second instead of using a book or the whole library to get the information thaqt your searching for . Social media helped on making the whole world a small city so that every one can communicate esaliy instead of going to the person to his own place you chat with him on any of social media applications and finesh your work way your laying on your bed and eating popcorn.However  their is a lot of advantage when it comes to using social media but that dosent mean that social media dosent have a bad affect,Being  addcatied to social media is one of the horoble issues that can affect some people, Also cybercrimes  and its bad when kids become a victim of cybercrimes  thats an individual affect . But to the society its more offal because it might give you the wrong information and some of the information are untrusted . Furthermore their are so many people  discuss political issues and that what make some trouble between a lot of countries.To  avoied being a victim on social media ,You should be careful with whom your communicating  and change your password every month and the stronger  password the better.Also  always check if the information you're looking for is 100% trusted you can make a survey to be sure about it and the adults should alway check behinde childrines because some of them have no clue about cybercrime.
Social media can affect both individuals and socities in bad or good ways, but nowadays it is important for us to communicate through it. Socialization through the social media can offer us the oppurtunity for us to make new friends, trade new ideas,  share some interesting content and pictures as well. Another way of getting a positve impact from the social media is  you could learn new cultures from people all around the world by getting to know them. Social media is a good way to adverstise products if someone has opened a business and wants it to grow bigger quickly. Negative affects on the social media could isolate introvert people from the real world by ignoring everything around them. One of the most common affect is either online bullying and harrasment, some sly people would target young girls and that might cause them to fall prey to online attacks which can create tension. Privacy is very important as well, revealing some information as some users do so can make them feel vulnerable and might lead to stalking too.
The UAE has witnessed a flourishing development in it;s economy and society in the past decade. In this essay I will be discussing the most important developments in the UAE both in technology and infrastructure. The UAE began as a deserted country with little to no means of transportation and buildings, with the coming years Shaikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan may he rest in peace, started the evolution of the UAE with discovering the oil and then his children and the Al Maktoum family completed his mission  even after his paasing and to this day.  Building the tallest tower in the world in Dubai which was finished in 2009. The capital Abu Dhabi left no place for critics when they announced that the Frenvh Louver museum will be openning it's first branch in the middle east and world wide as it was established in 2017. In addition to the economic dvelopment, the UAE went through an eco upgrade by making the first ever eco-friendly Masdar city in the middle east. Masdar city is one of the most sustainable urban communities having wind turbines and solar pannels to provide electricity, recyclying rusing and reducing waste is the master plan for Masdar city. To conclude, the UAE will continue to develop but  never leave it's heritage and roots, while developing to meet the economical expectation, the UAE will also continue to provide eco-friendly substitutes and agricultural development .

From a six year old kid to 60 year old man most people seem to be addicted to them. Since social media has become what it is today it has had many affects on individuals and society. When it was first introduced it was a mean to communicate with friends and family and to meet new people. Unfortunatly social media has taken a dark turn, nowadays social media has become more of a weapon than a communating platform It is used and abused by news channels to brainwash people or by politicians to impose their opinion. It also allowed people with no knowledge or experience in any given field to voice their opinion and talk about things they don't know about. Although there are some negative affects to social media there are also some positive ones. For example many people launch ''hashtags'' to support a certain cause and this has proven effective, the most recent example is that of the amazon fire when millions of social media activist urged goverments to help stop the fire and man responded. Overall social media has both negative and positive affects on both idividuals and the society itself.

social media everything in this huge univers have pros and cons.  The same thing is for social media. In my opinion I see that it all about the way that you are using it. so its diffrent from  person to other. However, one of the advanteges of social media is keeps you updated . you know  latest news . celebrites news. with only one botton. So I see that its so useful for us. Anyways, if you stay  a long time on social media with doing nothing else, surely  will effect you in  negative way. so if you control yourself and choose a time in a day you can browse or checking your social media accounts. this way social media will not effect you negetively. If everybody does this, then the world will gradually will be a better place to live in. Because setting for a long time at social media mean that you wont be able to do something else, day by day this will effect the society in many majors.  will effect your mental health also. and its  very important element for a successful society. Anyways,if  everyone has selfcontrol, i am sure that we can do so many things for our community  (united arab emirates) finally, i would like to say that i know so many people  are giftes but its all hidden behind setting at home doing nothing and being lazy. we all have to collabrate to make the world or the community  better place to live in, show us your talent and do your hobbies in your free time instead of checking your accounts all the time .
Social media has a big role in our lifes, a lot of people especially teenagers sit on social media apps for hours. Social media has a lot of effects on people, first, the individual will be isolated. Second the individual won't communicate with family members. Third and lastely, society won't work well together. First, people or mostly teenagers can get addicted to social media,  sit on it for hours without feeling that time has passed. A lot of games are online now, for example PUPG, people talk with each other while playing. Now that a lot of countries have this compitiion between people playing social media trend games, and whoever wins gets a huge prize. Second, an individual will be isolated in his own bubble, he won't communicate with family members and friends. Most teenagers fro example sit in their dark room with their phones and laptops and they browse social media apps, without knowong what is happening in the world or what is happening around them in their own house. Third and lastely, societies won't be able to work together if everyone is sitting on social media and looking stalking or following influencers. In order for a society to work together they need to communicate and work in groups. Society won't develop if all they do is sit and browse social media. In conclusion social media harms an individual and the individual will harm the society, so all of us should be careful about the way we use social media, and not to become addicted to it.

I believe that social media has two sides , positive effect and  negative effect. First, this paragraph focuses on how social media affect individuals in  negative and positive way. Social media programs has made a lot of changes these days,it is improved the individuals knowledgement. For example, There are many accounts and bloggers that share a lot of good informations about a different topics on a funny way, and when the user read it or see it his knowledge increase , and I saw that on my self. Furthermore, Social media help a lot of people on thier projects and offer an easy ways to earn money. For instance,a  lot of emiratie families has started thier own project, such as selling food , or homemade clothes and other items . On the other hand, social media make the individuals more inscure and antisocials.

Second, this paragraph focuses on how social media affect the society. After the social media appears a lot of things on the society has changed. For instance, the way of shopping and ending your work on any company has become easier and faster, you can end all of this on just a few minutes because of social media programs. Also, social media programs affect negatively on the society. For example, the apperance has become the first thing on the society, which make the people under pressure to always looks good and luxury just to snap it and be a part of the social media society. To conclude, Social media is a dangeours place that you have tu use it wiedly , and a very helpful place on the other hand.
The world we live in is a world of technology, we use it in our day to day life. A part of this world is social media. It became so important that we cannot live without it. But we should recognize the positive and negative affects that social media platforms has on us. Social media became a huge part of our lives, we stay on our phones most of the day just scrolling down social medias. But do we know the affect it has on us? One of the positive affects on us is that it makes us closer to people. Through social media platforms, we can meet new people from all around the world, we can learn from them about their culture, and we can also teach them about ours. But if we become addicted to these social media platforms, it could destroy our lives. A negative affect about those platforms is the rumors and fake news that spread very quickly through them, and sadly, a lot of people believe those rumors that can destroy the lives of others. That is why we should be careful when using social media, so we don't fall in its deep black hole. In my opinion, social media platforms are really important in my life. Without them I wouldn't be able to connect with my friends from around the world. But as a user of social medias, I know its negative and positive impacts on me, and my society should know them too so it wouldn't turn into a bad influenced society.

Social media and its affects on society Nowadays, social media has taken over society. All members of society whether they're young or old can have access to the internet. This has caused a huge change in society in the past ten years. People's interactions, habits and daily experiences have witnessed an enourmous change. As social media applications like; Facebook, Instagram and Youtube have grown bigger, they have been the most effective form of spreading awareness of the latest news of the community and its people.  Eventhough social media can be convenient in this department, it can also be a source of problems for the majority of people. Social media is open and available to everybody. Some might argue about the issue in this case. Here, the problem is its over-accessability. Children, teenagers and even the mentally ill can easily misuse these platforms by bullying others, blackmailing and other misconducts that are legally considered of high priority crimes. Parents might also argue that this wide-range accessability leaves their children with screen addiction problems. Therefore, social media also affects family bonds. The spread of these multi-million social media platforms may have started for a good cause. However, we tend to over-relay which is where the problem starts.

Second, To grow tolerance in our community, it have to be taught in schools and small communities, also it have to be taught to parents so children can learn it faster. we have to value tolerance cause of its big benefit back to us the humans. In the end, tolerance will prevent big tragidies and problems like big wars or even civil wars, it will make people good to each other and  will be able to live happily with each other with love and acceptance.
Social Media Social media has a huge affect on the individual itself and it could be  bad or good influence, it depends on how you use it and what sector you are in. Social media could be used for work, education, hospitals, socilaizing and contacing with the other people, it has more benefits than it downsides. You can develop your skills via social media by following teaching accounts such as; language, cooking, makeup tutorials or whatever hoppy you like. Also social media it consider as  work that you can seek for a job at, for example if you are  employee in a specific company you can serve the customer by contacting or replying to customers by the company's Twitter, Instagram or any other social media accounts that they need help but can not go to the company. Also social media could be dangours if you did not use it in the right way, you have to be secure and not telling anyone your personal informations so the can not hack your accounts or pictures and your privacy. Social media could end many lives when teengers or any person who get bully at social  when they get comments in their posts negative and bad words like """you" look "ugly!""" , """you" are "fat""" or similar words that lead them to feel bad about their selves and they could commit suicide. Technology and social media can improve many skills and services  whether it affect the indiviual itself or the whole society  if they use it in a right way and not the opposite, people should be informed  what they will face if they use it in a wrong way so they can be careful.
Today the term social media is all over the place. It's really rare to find someone who dose'nt use social media. Children use it to watch cartoons on Youtbe, Teenagers and adults use it to check for information, and chat with their friends and relatives who may be in a different country. Social media has it's pros and cons which i will present in this essay. Social media is an isolated digital world that has somehow made life easier. You would ask, How has it made life easier?. Well, the process of gathering information for task is so much easier. You can access any information you need with a click of a button, which saves time and effort. Another thing,   it made it  alot more easier to communicate, such as checking up on a family member who is 50 kilometers away,  chating with friends by a message or even a videocall.  However, Social media also has it's bad side. Cyberbullying is becoming a new common word, which tells  alot about the bad side of social media. It means that when people tend to bully others online. This causes  alot of damage to the victim mentally, and may lead to phsical problems and also  commit suicide. To conclude, Social media has it's good and bad sides. I really think that it depends on the person who is using it, if the person is using it for getting information, he will see the good side and that it is useful. And if  using it to bully it means that he's in the dark side of it.
 effects of Social media Nowadays, everyone use social media from childrens to elders, it is very common. We use it for fun,  communicate to others, and to know what is going on  the world. I'm here to talk about it's effect on individuals and society. First, individuals are part of society, so let's begin with them and see the effects. individuals take around 8-9 hours a day on social media, which will lead them to an eyes issues, they will need to wear glasses later on. Moreover, everything they hear or see they share it even that it is fake, this will make people believe everything that they hear or say. the childrens are the one who will  effect the most, their families do not watch what they are watching or hearing, maybe they will learn bad things or even share something bad. Second, after talking about individuals we can now talk about the society. things are easily to move from  person to another. so this will make some people hate each other. Furthermore, the society will be lazy, I mean that they will work less, because their time is on social media watching what people do. To sum up, in my opinion social media is important to know what is happening. but let us reduce the hours of using it , and work hard to make our country succeccful and better.
Social media is a variety of platforms that aid in communication between users through the internet, and it can come in many forms. The most common social media platforms being used are instagram, twitter, snapchat, and youtube. In all these social media platforms, there are famous influencers.
