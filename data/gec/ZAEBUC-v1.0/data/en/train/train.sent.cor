Developments in the UAE, located in the Middle East: a very calm yet geographic country known as the United Arab Emirates The UAE has a desert climate,  where it's sometimes pleasantly cold when it is wintertime,  and the weather gets really hot when it is summer; it is sometimes sunny and sometimes humid. Nearby countries make the heat unbearable according to their weather. Rains make the citizens of the UAE happy because it is rare to rain after a hot season. However, rain comes in the form of showers or/and downpours. The UAE promotes happiness,  where the government's goal is to spread positivity and joy  to the citizens, and that is done by non-profit organizations. People wake up early in the morning and get ready to go to work, school or university or even to drop their child off somewhere. Recently, the announcements in the UAE have been aiming to highlight the country as a global capital for tolerance (due to what its greatest ruler, known as Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan - and he was the UAE's first president - prefers and wants), in which people should create peace and love for each other. Spreading happiness is also a big goal and aim in the country.
In the past few days, I noticed that there is something wrong with people; the social media has affected so many people. There are advantages and disadvantages; some of them are good, and some of them are bad. For example, we can learn a lot of things from social media; it could help us to build our mind with a lot of information. Also, it will help us a lot in the future. There are some bad effects as well; it could be dangerous for our health, especially now in this developed society; it also may affect our eyes and mind as well because we put our effort in it, and sometimes, the social media makes people confused, and they don't trust theirselves;  they only trust the social media. Social media affects children the most because they keep playing games that will ruin their minds, and they'll be attracted, and talking to strangers is the most dangerous thing that the kids will do; they are still young; they believe things so easily. In general, the social media can affect many people, young or old....
Social media in this generation is very bad; all the people want to be famous on the social media; some people are famous in a good way, but some people are the reverse. Social media is affecting a lot of the people in the society because it's affecting them by making people   busier with their phones, and they don't focus on their lives anymore, and they focus on other things, and that affects students too;  they will be always on their phones as if they don't have to study, and they don't care about their studies,  and people are bullying people using social media that affects the physical [INCOMPLETE]
Nowadays, the UAE country has much trouble with social media around the community anywhere in places. However, social media is a huge group of technologies which  controls the network, but it is dangerous for our mind and health. Also, it can affect our children  using phones, video games and computers. To begin with, social media is a large group of societies that people can  work with. Unfortunately, it is not good for children over 12 using mobiles; maybe it will damage their mind, and they will lose their life  like other children. Parents would rather their children use their own social media  because they will meet new strangers on their Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat. Moreover, they will lose their society and also their life too. Being in society, which is a group of people, most of the young people who usually use social media  are not using it for real,  for necessity or for any subject; only they take it for fun and for what comes with it. At least, the government should ban some social media for the next generation because of these issues.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Nowadays, most people have telephones and can use the Internet by using social media. We can interact with others and find information about everything. However, despite these skeptical views, some opponents believe that social media makes people robotic and makes them become nerds. In the past, people would contact with others face to face or write volumes of letters, but now, people use Instagram or Facebook and just text some emojis  staring down at their phones. It could be said that people become sticks and unnatural, whereas, in my opinion, although there are some drawbacks to social media, it has brought forth good fruits on society. Consider how comfortable  getting much information is on social media, including, but not limited to, different cultures, news, politics, travel information, etc... It's connected with all. I cannot imagine my life without phones. Society will develop forever, and then we should use that technology. Do not be confined by old thoughts, and do not abandon new ideas.
Social media has a lot of effects on the world;  it affects in good and bad ways.  Social media affects individuals and society. I will talk about how social media affects the individuals in both ways. There are a lot of things by which social media can affect people in a bad way.  Some of these things are that  they use social media 24 hours per day without doing anything else.  Also, they eat a lot. Maybe the social media affects their health too because when people use social media, they don't want to go out,  walk or do some exercise; they just want to sit on the mobile phone and eat all the day, so that is wrong for their body and health. In the good way, social media could let people have  new friends from other countries. Also, it could let people contact with their teachers at the university if they have some important questions. People can learn new things from social media they didn't know  before. How does social media affect the society? Social media could do some big problems to the society; like it's maybe  a big fight between two countries because of some wrong things that happened on the social media. The good things that social media could give to the society are the development,  evolution and urbanism. Social media is so good, but you must use it in the good way. It will help you and the society a lot, but you must use it in a good way and do some good things on it.
Today, there are many new things that affect  our society, for example, the social media. There are many social media programs:  Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook,  Instagram and Snapchat. Those are the most popular programs in the UAE. People can contact easily and share much information on social media, and that affects  the person and society. Families need to be more careful with their children if they use these programs because there are many risky people they will talk with;  also, these programs are not allowed for children under 13. Another thing is some people spend a long time on these media, and that will affect negatively  their health. Social media also affects  our society because there are a lot of bad people who want to destroy the society. It also will affect  the works because people spend a lot of time on the social media and don't do their job.
With the UAE announcing the year 2019 as the year of tolerance, many initiatives were launched to promote it among the society, but nothing can come before the historical visit of the Pope of Vatican in the beginning of the year to the UAE,  the meetings he held with the leaders of the UAE,  the agreement he signed with the Grand Imam of Alazhar, as a representative of the Muslim world, and, of course, the mass he held at the largest sport venue in the UAE, Zayed Sports City. This visit has opened a huge door for people to learn more about their partners in the world from other religions and created a new wave of joint efforts from Muslims, Christians and Jews to  work on the similarity between them instead of emphasizing the differences. From my point of view, the UAE, by this visit, took a huge step in promoting a culture of tolerance and made a legacy that made not only the locals but everyone in the UAE proud of it, and this pride, to be kept, has to be presented by implementing the wells of the brothering humanitarian meeting and reflecting it on the society and on its people.
  Nowadays, we can see that the social media affects our world, but how does it affect the world? And does it affect it in a negative way or in a good way? In this text, I will discuss how  social media affects our world in an individual way and in society. What is the social media? We all know that it is a way to be in public and make the world know you; also, it makes you famous, but everything  has a negative side; like the social media can drive people to kill themselves; also, it can affect your life, from happy to sad and from a good person to a bad person. So how can we  avoid this  happening? First, if we think about it in an individual way, the social media can make you know everything  about the world, and it can acknowledge you; also, it can provide you with a lot of information that you didn't know before, but it can also drive you on a negative side; for example, you will always want to be like the others; you will go into a lot of information that you don't need, and it's bad for you. Second, in society, the social media can lead to a lot of fights and destroy the world, but it also has  positive things; like it makes people know each other, and it makes the world know about everything  in the other countries, so that means it can make  strong relations in the world. In conclusion, I have talked about the negative and the positive side of both, and in my opinion, I think that the social media is a good thing, but everything  has a good and a bad side.
Nowadays, social media is so popular and important to everyone, whether they were kids or adults. In each Emirati house, there is at least one person who's on social media. So, for sure, there are some effects that social media did to individuals and the whole society. At first, let me explain how  social media affects individuals and society by several points. First of all, social media made it easier for people to connect with their families and friends, so that made a social gap in our society. Because of the easy connection, people now don't visit their families and friends like before. The second effect is that kids now are using social media too, which is bad for them because on social media, there are so many bad things that kids should not watch. In addition, when little kids are using social media, they would not play outside,  be active and act like normal kids, which makes them lazy and fat. Also, these days, social media helped and played a big role in spreading rumors and false news, and this can be very dangerous for the government and the whole society, so no one should believe everything on social media.
I think that the most important thing that the UAE has done  huge developments in is society and its culture, which made the UAE from the world's lowest economy to the highest of them all. They have started to get stronger by all ways that they made everything equal in every ministry, which is something hard to achieve these days in other countries. Our passport now is the highest-ranked  passport among all countries of the world, and that's thanks to the Ministry of the Affairs. The government had proved to all countries in the world that it can achieve anything and do anything if it does the right choice, which is something good for the country and good for the people who are living on its lands. There  are some huge developments that the UAE has done along these years - from the day it united together till the day we are on right now, and it is hard to forget all the hard work that the government has done for us. We have all kinds of ministries in the UAE, and there are the good ones, and there are the ones that are not doing well, but the day will come for all of the ministries that they will work hard and achieve what the country wants.
Many people these days use the social media to be in touch with their friends and to know about what happened in the world.  Nowadays, people can find jobs also by searching in the company's posts on social media. Social media can affect the people in good and bad ways. The benefit of using social media is that people can be aware of what's happening in the world and the latest news. Also, many people prefer to read the news online rather than in papers; that can help save the world from wasting more paper.  However, social media leads people to spend most of their time away from each other in reality. Many people who use the social media a lot spend less time with their families; that can let the parents now take a bad idea of social media. In my opinion, I think social media is good if we use it for good things and never forget our life, family and  jobs.
In the UAE, they are improving a lot. For example, now, they are making some robotics, and it is changing a lot in the UAE; also,  in Fujairah, they are making the place better and nicer to go to,  and the UAE is making more improvements for the people from  outside the country to come and visit it. Nowadays, the government schools are improving to concentrate more on English and on all the subjects; also,  they are improving the hospitals and also,  they're trying to ban the plastic because it is  wasting the environment in the UAE.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media nowadays is playing a big role in society. It can affect the people in good ways and bad ways. Social media has been around for years, but it has been developed where new sites and new apps are being put out there for the people. Social media is a source where people can communicate, post about their daily lives, make money out of promotions and much more. People can create content and make a platform using social media, which can make people big, and for that, they can get paid. The problem with social media is that there is a dark side to it where people can get bullied, exposed, blackmailed and so on. The bright side of social media is that people create their own platform, where they can get paid for sponsorships,  get paid for creative content,  sell merchandise or sell their products;  people who make this type of content are called influencers. These influencers can fall in many categories, such as beauty influencer, lifestyle influencer, bloggers and many more. Influencers make content to teach, suggest and talk about anything in life that can benefit their followers. Social media, in my opinion, is a really great way to communicate and take pictures and videos to share to your Snapchat or Instagram story, and really, everything is great about it, but people or society needs to be careful because whatever's on the Internet stays on the Internet.
How does social media affect individuals in society? In the world we live in today, social media is a very significant part of our lives. We use social media all the time for just about everything, including contacting friends, family, business partners and so on. We also use it to update our followers with what we are doing currently on our """stories""" on Instagram and Snapchat. It makes our lives so much easier than if we didn't have social media. It is something most of us use daily - sometimes not because we need to, but because we want to; but just like anything else, social media can be used in a good or bad way. In this day and age, many people use it to slander, harass or even threaten other people, and this can and has already caused a lot of problems. I do not condone such acts, but in my opinion, this was bound to happen with or without social media. This is a huge step in our world, and I cannot tell where social media is going, but I am sure that it will always be a part of our lives, no matter what.
At the moment, the UAE has developed a lot in many things, but the most important are  technology,  electric things,  schools, universities and malls. In this essay, I will give my opinion about the most important development in the UAE. The UAE has developed in many things, but the most important thing is  technology. Nowadays in the UAE, everything  people want to do, they can do  by smartphone  and some applications that  make life easier; people can sit at home and finish their work; for example, if someone wants to pay for Etisalat or an electric and water company, we do not have to go there; there is some machine we can pay with,  and it is easier for workers to finish or submit some important work. Furthermore, the UAE wants to be developed in every single thing. However, the UAE government wants to make creative people; they want  young people to be much creative and to create amazing things to make future life easier for the resident. Also, in hospitals, there are many important electric things for the patient; this is one of the important things in the UAE. In the end, the UAE will be more developed in the future, and there will be more important developed things. In my opinion, young people will be more creative, and they will create amazing things.
Social media has a big effect on the world by different types, such as good ways or bad ways.  Nowadays, we use social media; it is important in our life; it has a big role; we use it in our work and study and to contact easily with the world in different countries. However, it has too many facts, such as hacking your account and knowing your secret information. Teenagers who are between 14-16  get too many problems from the social media, like they use it in  bad ways, so they face too many bad words, so it could be bullying. Furthermore, parents see that social media for their kids is sometimes not good as much as the old way in which they grew up when they were  the same age, so they try to avoid the problems that keep them angry with their children. In my opinion, I see that social media is much better; it helps our life, and it affects  our study. I,  as a student at university,  can easily open a new business, and I can share it with friends and family on social media; so at an early age, I can get my own business, and I can make my own salary, so I can also help my family not to  get tired of my study fees.
The UAE is a famous country; all people know about it, and all the world sees how  the UAE can develop more than in the past, so the most important development in the UAE at this moment is the passport of the UAE; it is the first passport in all the  world; that shows us that no country can be famous like the UAE; that makes us be  an example for many different countries; so the developments are the most important thing that happened in the UAE; so to be an Emirati person is a great feeling, and I want to live to see more developments in the UAE and be a grateful girl;  and I see that the UAE works hard to show the humanity around the world that the successful country can be a famous country. All people talk about the development in the UAE in the bigger news around the world, and all people hope to visit to protect our country from all  people who hate and don't want  good things to happen in the UAE, and we can protect our country; it is a beautiful thing; I hope all people who live in the UAE have a great life, are  happy and see how  the UAE can develop more at this moment. 
There are many social media programs, like Facebook, Twitter,  Snapchat and Instagram. Those social media can have both sides; it can be negative and positive. People use it to communicate with each other, but some people use it in a bad way, like talking in bad ways;  in this position, you can go to the jail because of what you say. In addition, even if you post  bad photos of  an animal, and you mean your friend, this means you are bullying  them, so this  can be very harmful for them. On the other hand, in society, this  can be very dangerous and, of course, cause side effects in our society.
In this essay, I will write about  social media; it is an important thing in our society because we can find everything we want;  also, social media can affect our society because some people use it in the wrong way. For example, they use  nasty words against each other and talk about the politics. Some people use it in a good way; they use it to  contact with each other and do relationships with people.  The social media benefits people who want to do a trade, and they profit money. About myself, I like  social media, and I use it in a good way because I make  good relationships, and I would like to make a trade in the future.  I know some people on social media who have a lot of money because they use it in a good way that changed their life and made it better than before. I would like to use it in a good way all the time because it will benefit me in the future. In conclusion,  social media has  good things and bad things.  People should know how to use it and how to avoid the bad behavior on social media.
These days, social media becomes a spread like a disease; kids and adults use social media like they drink  water!! This is affecting a lot in our society. People are not meeting or sitting with each other; they are only chatting and [INCOMPLETE]
Social media is applications on which people are able to share or create content and participate in networking. Social media has a lot of effects on individuals and society. There are several effects; one of the most important effects is  knowing people all over the world.
Social media affects in    different ways, and there are some negative things and  positive things that affect  our individuals and society. This time, the social media affects   different ages, such as from the smallest to the biggest people. In the positive way, it can help the society; if they have a business,  they can open an account, for example, on Instagram to share their business,  have more customers and  have a new way to share their business. On the other hand, it will be a negative thing for the children cause it affects  them in many ways.  One of these negative things is that they will not live their child's life cause they will be playing and sitting on their iPads the whole day without  doing  something.  Social media has many positive and negative things, and I mentioned some of them.
Social media can be a good way to affect  you and a bad way too; the good way, as an example, is that it helps us contact our family, friends and our beloved ones in an easy way, and life became easier too; we also can search for things that we need to know about; we have Safari, Chrome and friends to ask. Furthermore, as it has a positive side, it has a negative side too, which  can affect our eyes and health because most of the time, people are just holding the phone or laptops. Moreover, it can affect the society in a good and a bad way too; students can now search for their research and get the information in a couple of seconds; they can make online surveys for their projects, and they can talk to people and get new information too. People that have businesses can promote their businesses through social media;  they can talk to influencers to make an advertisement, or they can make a video and send it to others; also, we don't need television and to wait for the news to come; we can know the news on social media in just a few minutes as we also have some specific accounts that are there just for letting people know what's happening  in the world. You can do all of that  while you're sitting at home. In the other hand, people use social media in  bad ways; as an example, they use it to bully someone or throw negative comments out there; even they can hack your accounts or steal your information; it all depends on how  you use it. 
These days, social media is the most popular way to spread out your opinion and to communicate with others from a far distance; also, in jobs, they use these techniques; if a mother wants to sit with her kids and work from her house, she can easily do that. Social media has some advantages and disadvantages; some advantages are like it helps people out, but the disadvantages are that there will be distance between them and their families because of their distance, while for the society, it helps all the counties around to know more about their country. Families nowadays have distance between them and their child, so they have to give some time and stay with them because this thing really affects  family issues. Moreover, some use it in a way to save photos and ask for money,  or they'll post them, and everyone will see them. This problem has faced many parents, so what I would  like to say is  don't stop your kid from using it, but at least put some time and sit together because it helps them when they grow; and as we know,  these days, social media is taking all our time, and we can't manage our daily routine. I hope that we can get rid of all of this,  try to manage time,  keep time and stay with our family.
 Nowadays, social media is very important for many people in  different ways. No one can live without using their phone and contacting with the wide world.  This essay will discuss how people use social media and how it  affects  the society. Social media these days can let you know more about other countries and contact with people around the world, but that may be dangerous for people who chat with bad people, especially the teenagers; they can learn bad words and actions. Furthermore, social media can affect  the person in a bad way, like getting too attached for many hours, sitting on the phone, being overweight and so many other diseases. On the other hand, social media can improve the social skills for the person to be more confident and sociable, like identifying new civilizations.  Also, social media can help people who can't go to university or don't have time to learn at home in many different applications and websites. Another advantageous effect is that people can know more about each other and make  new friends and relationships. In conclusion, social media can affect in a negative or positive way  the person, so the person should control himself by managing the time for sitting on social media and putting limits for himself.
The development  is important to humans' life. This is because it helps us learn and know how to live a successful life, such as technology; so the   UAE needs to develop the streets for bicycles  because it is dangerous for their life, so they should make  streets for bicycles; that is so important and helpful  for people who like to drive bicycles. For example, that will let the streets not be crowded by the cars and buses, and bicycles  are faster than them, but it is dangerous to drive bicycles in the UAE because they don't have  safe streets for bicycles; so I think people should say to the government  that they need to develop the streets because it is a big problem for people who like driving bicycles in the UAE; and for the visitors, that will really help the people who like bicycles to be safe from danger.
 Social media could pretty surely harm  individuals and society. Each person now has  social media on their  smartphone. In my opinion, using social media most of the time  usually will affect  our health. If we do not have awareness of the disadvantages of using social media, we obviously will lose our good health. For instance, we might have a hurt back and less sight. There are so many cases if we don't use social media in the right way. That means we need to focus and use it if we have a necessary situation or use it for a short time. When parents sit all the time on their phones on social media without communication with their family members, the other ones will have the same habit of wasting their time using those harmful social media. I think the government must teach the society how that will let them be so apart from their life. Children also might use the social media for more hours than the adult people. This might let children  stop studying well, and that will affect  their grades because they will  have an addiction to using social media so much in their daily life. Also, some people can be sensitive if they saw someone bully them in front of all people. That might let them feel bad about themselves and think about that all the time, and they will not have  positive energy. So people need to improve themselves, have awareness and stay away from those harmful social media.
The social media has a big effect on individuals and society. There are  positive effects and negative effects. The positive effect is that we can learn many things from the social media, such as fashion, health, decoration and some good ideas. We can learn from the fashion; they show us the new shops,  where we can buy the dress from and how to wear  nice clothes in the perfect place. For example, in the wedding, we should wear a pretty dress from the place that they told us about. There are many doctors on the social media who give us much advice to learn  without  visiting the doctor, such as the gym, diet, exercises and other diseases. On social media,  anybody can easily know how to decorate their room or house. There are a lot of negative effects from the social media. First of all, the children play all the time on the phone, and they don't focus on studying. Secondly, there are some people on the social media who say bad words, and they have a lot of followers. Thirdly,   nowadays, people sit alone all the time because of the social media; they don't visit each other.
Last year, the UAE started to build many  buildings, such as companies, hotels, hospitals and schools. The UAE is working to develop our country more and more to be the highest in the future. Furthermore, when the country is  modern, that can get many  tourists, so that can affect positively  our economy by increasing [INCOMPLETE]. Here we can see the benefits that our country can get when it   works hard to develop and become modern. One of the most modern cities in the UAE is Dubai. It has many  tourists from other countries, especially from Saudi Arabia. They come to see the Khalifa Tower and visit Dubai Mall and the City Walk. These are the most popular and beautiful places in Dubai. Moreover, the UAE is amazing in the winter because some places are outdoor so they can enjoy their time. That's why the UAE shouldn't stop  developing the country and should keep going to get more and more  tourists.
The UAE has had  lots of developments from the past till  nowadays. The UAE president, Sheikh Zayed, helped the UAE to be bigger and better step by step until we became a modern country, then he passed out. Afterwards, his son, Sheikh Khalifa, made it more developed, and he built the Khalifa Tower, which is the tallest tower in the world. Dubai  nowadays became so famous, and even  non-Emirati people know Dubai. The Khalifa Tower is one of the most important developments in the UAE, which made the UAE more famous, and a lot of visitors come to Dubai on their holidays. There are a lot of other important developments in the UAE, such as museum features, but the most important thing in my opinion is the Khalifa Tower. The Khalifa Tower gathers a lot of people; also, there were a lot of celebrities who visited Dubai's famous tower; also, the view made a lot of people be interested to come and see it in real life. The UAE is still developing; every year, they come up with new ideas to make our country bigger and better, and one of the most important developments is the Khalifa Tower, which made Dubai the way it is today.
 I think the most important development in the UAE  is the education; it changed a lot. For example,  they focus more on the study.  In the past, the students' study was from books, but now in the UAE, they try to study developments by technology.  Also, the UAE tries to affect  people to study to be educated; the UAE does a lot for the community to be comfortable and to make everything to develop the country;  also, when people  see the country care about them,   the community will be comfortable about everything.  We should study to make our country better and better and developed;  also, the UAE develops the transportation. 
More than 10,000,000  people in this world use social media;  it is very important in these days; some people can't live one without their phone because they are addicted. The social media   has positive and negative effects; it can affect the person and the society;  it can help the society in many sides; for example, it helps the country to develop and know more about other cultures and traditions. It helps the person to make  relationships from inside and outside the country, learn a new language and take  experience from others, but it also has a negative side that can affect the person; for example, it puts him in a different world, he loves being alone, he doesn't like to sit with other people and he doesn't like to make  relationships.  In my opinion, I think social media is good and helpful for our society, and it helps our society a lot to develop;  also, our life is nothing without social media because it helps us a lot in our life.
Social media has many effects on the society and  individuals. One of them is that it makes the person completely isolated, and this will affect   the person psychologically. Also, it  affects human health. For example, it  causes sleep and food disturbances. On another hand, there are many effects on the society. One of them is the disintegration of society, and this is by their preoccupation in the virtual world. Also, the social media is an introduction to the dissemination of the culture of moral decay and corruption because these means, especially Facebook,   open society to all cultures, including with regard to the promotion of the values of corruption and decay. Social media has a lot of effects, so we should  be careful about  ourselves.
Social media is one of the most effective ways in the world. It might be useful or harmful to the individuals and society. In this essay, we will discuss how  the social media affects  the people and the society. On the one hand, social media has a lot of advantages to the world. First of all, it makes our life easy. For example, if your friend lives in another country, you can use the social media to know more about him even if you are far away from him. Also, social media eliminates boredom. If someone feels bored, the social media will reduce this feeling. Finally, with social media, you can express what is in your mind, which will improve  yourself. In the other hand, social media has several disadvantages to  ourself and the world. First of all, the screens of the computers and phones are harmful for the eyes. Moreover, it increases feelings of loneliness, which means increased autism between people. Finally, some websites are harmful to  children and adults. Social media is like a gun to our children, so we must save our children from these things because it is very dangerous for our society.
I think the most important development in the UAE at this moment is the development in education and in health, medicals and other things.
Nowadays, we have  social media; it affects our people in the world.  There are many apps on social media; we can connect with other people easily. However, social media affects the children; 58% of the children around the world use social media all the time. Therefore, many have  obesity in the world because many children at home, for just a few hours on the phone,  show videos from Instagram or Twitter on WhatsApp. Also, many people are busy with their phone when they drive the car; that makes more accidents.  Social media now affects the society around the world easily; when the people need anything, they easily will find it. We have news  every time on social media, but at other times, we have  bad news;   when we have  bad news, it will be around the world. Despite having many nice things on the social media, but there are many effects on society.  They should have a solution to  reduce this effect.  The best solution is to reduce the negative things on social media and do more to have  many positive things because we have many children affected on social media,  and they're using the social media all the time.  We have many solutions we can use.
The social media has affected the world in bad and good ways; the fact is the one who uses the social media apps can choose how he can use them. In our life, the social media is very important and keeps us in constant evolution, and we know what is new; and for the individuals, it helps every person to know about themselves more; also, they connect with other people from another country, so they will learn about their culture and tradition. Also, the social media can make a person's character, and that  depends on the person, and it impacts on the world of business;  now, they can post on the apps, like  Twitter and Instagram, and it became too easy  across the whole world;  for the society,  the social media helped and changed the culture, in general, making the world a smaller and more intimate place. Well, no one has an objection to social media's effect and how it's important. 
Social media is very important; nowadays, it helps us to know what happens around us.  Social media can affect individuals and society positively  because it keeps us aware of things that we didn't know.   Also, social media has new good things we can take advantage of,   such as reading news and contacting with our family and friends. 
 Nowadays, a lot of people are using social media, and they don't consider   the bad effects that the social media contains. How are people  using it, and how much time do they spend on it? It's not about the quantity. It's about the quality. All of us may use social media, but how many of us are using social media in the right way? We know that everything has advantages and disadvantages. Social media has a very big effect on us and on the community; because of that, we have to use it very carefully. Always, we always have to be careful about what we post on it. Who are the people I'm following?  Am I in the right place?  Always people do what others did, so be careful about this. As I said, it's not about the quantity; it's about the quality. Before you post  anything, think about the others; it may affect them or the society.
Social media has been changing every year. It's important to our life. Furthermore, social media includes YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. These applications have many different impacts on individuals and society. However, social media is wasting their time, and social media can make a lot of cyberbullying. First of all, social media plays a big role in our time. It's wasting our time to do our activities. For example, when you [INCOMPLETE]
In my opinion, I think that the most important development in our country is  to make a rocket ship to make a fake moon and to see if people can live there or not. They were working on this project for years; it was their goal; they want to be successful in their project. It takes a lot of  time to make the rocket ready to launch; it costs millions to make a rocket; they try to make our country  faster like other countries.  Our leaders give us support to create new things; also, our leaders support students to innovate things. They try to develop new rules; they try to develop buildings, roads and many more; they try to make us  hold our old culture. Our leaders give students [INCOMPLETE]
One of the important things in our life now is social media. Social media has many positive and negative effects. On the positive side, people can communicate from many places and countries, chat and do jobs, and sometimes  if the person uses this technology in the right way, it will save his time and labor. In addition, there  are negative effects; for example, spending a lot of time using these programs and technology leads to wasting time and being lazy; moreover, that will threaten our health, like diabetes, because we will spend much time sitting without any movement and eating without doing exercises. So everything  in our life has advantages and disadvantages, but that depends on the user - whether he used it correctly or not; so we have to know how to take advantage of it more than disadvantage.
Social media affects individuals and society. There  are negative and positive things about social media. However, social media affects individuals and society because it has  negative things. For example, people don't have time to sit with their families; also, it will be so bad for children because it easily  affects them, and that's  so hard for them, especially the children. In addition, it will affect the society because of spreading rumors, and that makes the relationships  of society bad. Also, it will affect individuals because on social media, there are bad stories that  will affect individuals, and they'll be doing the same bad things they saw  in the movies or the stories. However, there are positive things that help individuals and society on social media. For example, social media is important for asking about something and helps us in studying or something like that; also, it's good for chatting with another country,  teaching  them the language and also making happy relationships with others. Also, it's easy to do anything on social media without going  anyplace - just from where you are; and these are some bad and good things about social media and how it affects individuals and society.
Social media has many positive and negative effects; like we can use it to talk with friends and family, to share pictures and videos and also to learn a new thing and search for it, for example, Twitter and Instagram. Social media helps businesses in marketing. It is an effective and a good way to buy and sell. However, it takes your time away from your family, and you will feel lazy. Also, people can share some information that might pose threats to them and bad pictures. In my opinion, social media is a good way to communicate with family and friends, but not all the time of the day - with limits.
The UAE is one of the most developed countries, and it's trying to be the best in too many ways; for example, in education, it has a lot of schools and colleges with too many teachers to help the students in  different subjects. Also, in the medicine, it's trying to have  good and the best medical care for its citizens; but the most important development in our country, I think, is technology because it makes the UAE  faster in communication and transportation. For example, the people don't have to hire a car to go to their work or pay for the bus transportation; they just can work on their laptop or their computer.  Also, it helps the citizen students     in their classes; it might be hard for them to go to study at college, so they  can take their classes online;  so I think this is the most important at this moment.
Today, social media is very important to us. Social media has many apps that we use to talk to each other that can affect the person and the society in many ways. The person can prefer to stay alone and use these apps all the day, which wastes the time; it makes the person lazy to do the work. Also, it affects the mental health - so you lose focus - and it brings  back pain and eye problems. However, you can express your feelings by writing about them and sharing them with others; you can share the best moments with your friends, and you can communicate easily at any time. On the other hand, the social media increases the discrimination between the people, especially the teenagers; that makes them hate each other; they lose friends, and they feel not interested in others. The positive side is that you can have friends from different places, which develops the relationships between the countries; you can find out much information about what is going on around the world, and you can do your own trade to other places in the world. Social media can be good or bad; it depends on how you use it. In my opinion,  social media is a very good way to develop the person and the society.
  Nowadays, the social media has a huge impact on our daily lives;  there is a negative effect that makes a person busy in their virtual world,  but the most common positive points are to communicate with friends and people and to learn new benefits; but people should avoid dangers, like  not letting social media make them addicted because it takes a lot of time and doesn't make them finish their daily work,  and the social media reduces visits between parents.  Finally, we must have  self-control, time management and hard work;  if we have an addiction, we will lose our social environment.
These days, social media plays an important role in our society. So some people think that it's useful, while others believe that it affects our lives badly. This essay will discuss both sides and will draw my personal conclusion.  In one hand,  social media has  very important advantages; it makes you close to the outside world. For example,  if you are studying abroad, you can know what's happening in your country, and also you can communicate with your family or friends. Secondly,  if you want to search for  information, you will take it easier and quickly without going to professors because it takes too long time;  the professors  will not be  available every time for you.  On the other hand,  social media can affect your lives badly. For example,  if you sit too long on it, it may affect your health; also, when you're using it, you don't know everyone; you should pay attention to them because there are a lot of people who violate your privacy.  To sum up,  after a careful analysis of both points of view, I  believe that social media is important in our lives because it makes our lives easier in everything,  communication or study, so that's what makes it important.
  Nowadays, the social media is very important to the people, but also, it has  affected badly  our society.  There are some people who put a bad picture on the media, and it's bad for the children. Also, there is a lot of racism among people and bullying that make the social media bad for our society. Furthermore, the students  don't do their homework and study, and this makes them not smart. Also, it affects  your health. People who are addicted to social media may experience negative side effects, such as eye strain and lack of sleep. Also, the social media can bring stress;  if the people spent their time researching problems with people, they may experience stress, which can have a negative effect on their health. On the other hand, the social media is helpful for some people; for example, they can open a new business. In my opinion, social media is bad for our society because it affects badly  our society.
There is no doubt that the UAE is a developed country in the world at the moment;  there are many things that mention that the UAE is a developed country, such as in tourism,  economy,  and education. I think the most important development in the UAE is tourism for many reasons. First of all, the UAE is a global destination. Many people around the world  prefer to go to the UAE in the summer or in the winter and in a happy new year to spend a good time with family or friends. So tourist attractions are abundant in the UAE, for example,  Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is the highest tower in the UAE,  Dubai Mall, which is the biggest mall in the world,  Zayed Mosque  in Abu Dhabi and Ferrari World for a funny time. The next point is a safe country; people prefer to stay in a good and safe place for their safety and have no accident when they want to enjoy it. Finally, the UAE provided  another culture in the world, for example, a foreign restaurant;  they find their food, and that makes them comfortable.
In these days, social media is the most popular way to discover the news. There are a lot of programs that can be used for the social media programs, such as WhatsApp, Snapchat, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. There are some positive effects and some negatives. One of the positive effects is that we can easily get the information from those programs and know about all the  news. Second, we can communicate with the family or friends on those programs by chatting with them; also, we can see them through a video call. Finally, the social media programs can help us with several problems, like in the studying way. If we are  students, and we need some websites or people to explain the subjects for us, we can easily find them in those programs. As we know, there are also  negative effects of social media programs. For example, these programs affect badly  the young people because they don't know how to use them and when. Most of the children use their iPads for a long time and in the wrong way, and that affects them in a bad way. The social media makes the life  easy and much better than the past.
Social communication greatly affects the individual. There are many social media, such as Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and WhatsApp; but social media, in general, has advantages and disadvantages. It is social media frequent accidents that hurt society. At this time,  PUBG MOBILE came out, and it is one of its addictions for many people, including adults as well. In the focus of speech, if someone went to study abroad, social media is the market that links him with his family.
Social media is a thing that exists in every country and lives with us. Social media has so many applications that people can contact through; they  include the important applications, which are Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, WhatsApp and others. These applications help to make the people contact,  reach to each other and know everything about life and what's going on in other countries. Everything has a positive and a negative effect. Social media has a positive effect on how it makes the people talk to each other anywhere and anytime and know what's going on in the world without doing anything. This is an amazing thing  to have, and for sure, it is a positive thing for any person using social media because it will make them feel safe and comfortable.  However, there are some negative effects on society which  can make people become obsessed with social media, and this isn't a good thing because it may lead to broken relationships and reduce the timing that people must  have with their family. Also, it isn't a good thing because it may lead to  health problems, just because of wasting most of the time on social media. Social media now is a normal thing to have and lives with us, so it will be a little hard to stay away or try to live even 1 day without using social media.  This isn't  enough reason to stay for like 24/7 on social media.  People really must reduce the time that they use social media because it might cause risks to them; they have to try more than one time.
Social media Social media is the most effective thing in this century because the world has developed in many ways, and the social media is the most effective one and the fastest for having news,  being famous or telling fake information about people. However, we in this century  count on social media in every single thing in our life, such as studying,  buying stuff from online markets or texting people in other countries. Moreover, in the past, people would usually go out if they want to buy anything or send a letter  (takes one week inside the country and one month or maybe more to outside the country); it affected us in every single thing in our life.
There have been many things that are important developments in the UAE from the past till now, but the different development is education; they change a lot of it from the KG to grade 12.  Every year, they do a lot to make Emirati people  always the first in the world.  They make for all the students in high school technology to study from;   everywhere, we have a school to do more products every child at their home should have  to study. 
Nowadays, everyone  has a social media account. Social media has an effect that affects individuals and society. People can use their social media accounts in the right way and the wrong way. How does social media affect individuals and society? I know that everyone  asks this question to themselves.  Social media affects individuals and society with the wrong news and the way they put bad pictures. Also, sometimes, people write some tweets that show other people how they're bad and don't have a good personality. How can people deal with these effects? They should use their social media accounts in the right way, and you may not share any wrong things, like  news or whatever people share on their social media account. Friends can impact their close friends and let them share a bad thing or use social media in the wrong way, so don't trust anyone or anything you  see  on social media because not everything is right. It seems to me that people should use their own social media account in the right way and not be like other people who share wrong things and bad things. Bad things and wrong things  mean the news that people wrote  themselves,  and it's not  true news.
Social media  is one of the things that has fame. We find the social media in each house in our country. In our life, the social media makes our life easier. For example,  we connect with each other all the time, and we can know the new information happening in each minute. We can see clearly the effect of the social media. There are two sides on which the social media can affect us. The first side is that social media affects us individuals. We can see ourselves using the social media   most of the time in our life. Spending a lot of time using our phone  has a bad effect on us  when we lose our time. Some people stop working anymore because they have an online business on the social media; that makes the people not need to walk and work hard to have the money. Sometimes, social media makes small work easy; like there are teachers on the social media who help us a lot to have new information. In my opinion, the social media is so important for us to get information in an easy way, and that will help us to develop our country by seeing what the other countries do. In my opinion,  sometimes we can enjoy the social media. 
Nowadays, social media is popular  everywhere  and all over the world. Before social media, people used to chat by writing on paper. When social media came to us, the communication became much better and easier. This essay will describe how  social media affects individuals and society. Firstly, social media is very important for us to communicate with anyone. People can use it to communicate with others overseas,  and that makes it the best. Secondly, there are people who don't have the time to visit their friends or families; here, social media is the best way to chat with your family and friends. Finally, social media also has a negative effect on people. That is, when people stay at their home,  they don't go  anywhere else, and they just use social media all the time. It affects their relationship with their society. Moreover, social media is very important in our society even if it has a negative effect. To sum up, social media has many positive and negative effects on people. We must use it because it's useful, but we shouldn't use it all the time.
How does social media affect individuals and society? 100 years ago, all this technology was not found yet; people used to go and visit each other most of the time, either  by camels,  horses or even by walking for miles. Most people used to communicate by visiting each other, and that's how most of the news used to get explored all over the city. Social media can be any app that you can communicate or share any picture or video on by using the Wi-Fi or, let's say, 3G. There are many ways that people might use social media;  some can be positive, and some can be negative. Sadly, day by day, social media is getting worse; they keep using it in a negative way. Let's say some people abuse girls and boys of different ages. However, people started to get famous on Instagram and Snapchat in a way that they keep hurting others - let's say sharing embarrassing pictures of famous people or telling lies about them. What's most important is the way the person uses this app because he is the one to give instructions, not the app. People must start thinking wisely and take extra care of people's feelings because that might lead others to death.
Social media has a huge amount of effects on both individuals and society, but at the same time, it helps everyone with work, study, teaching and business. These days, social media is one of the most important things to have or to use in our life; it simplifies our life and makes it much easier. Some teenage students are given by their schools   iPads or MacBooks so they make  use of technology more; sometimes they use the technology they have to play with it and have fun, and some  really feel the happiness of using technology when they are using technology to study and do their work and homework. Technology has a side effect on the society and also individual people  using social media. It is 2019; most phones nowadays have an application or something in the setting that will let you know how much time  you use your social media a day; it will point at what  the most and least apps that you use are and how many hours a day  you use them. It helps you also if you need to manage your time to give yourself  time, like 3 hours a day only, and your phone will lock directly; it helps you save time on other things than technology.
How does social media affect individuals and society?  The effect of social media on society is the contribution from """us""" as a society accessing the World Wide Web. Social media has taken over the current generation through Twitter, Facebook or even Instagram; it has become as a race of who can """post""" or """tweet""" the latest fashion and news or even the latest rumor reports; but how do all these social media trends affect society and societies? The social media has  positive and negative effects, just like any other thing that has been created and introduced to humans; it just relies on the purpose of the use. The positive effect of social media, in my own modest opinion, is that the social media helps the whole planet interact through the outlets it offers; it can lead humans to understand and respect each other's traditions as well as culture. The negatives of social media can be disastrous as it can spread dangerous beliefs, racial ideas, opinions and ideologies through its outlets; as a result, it can start a racial war within the inside of a country. The social media can inspire an individual into  becoming a positive or a negative change in a society, depending on the use of its, sometimes, sensitive attractions.
Most people think that social media doesn't have any negative sides,  but it has more negative sides than benefits;  one of the effects is that it can serve as a platform for inappropriate actions. People might do or say things they wouldn't in real life because there are minimal rules for communication in social media. Another effect is that personal data and privacy can easily be hacked and shared on the Internet,  which can make financial losses and loss to personal life.  Similarly, identity theft is another issue that can give financial losses to anyone by hacking their personal accounts. Also, addiction can be one of the effects of social media, and it's  very bad and dangerous that someone is addicted to social media, and it can disturb personal lives as well. The teenagers are the most affected by the addiction of social media because they don't have any idea that social media can make them addicted to these applications.  Nowadays, most of our kids or children   have phones, and this thing leads them to be addicted, and also, as we have nowadays, online games  have the same effect of social media because they can chat with people they don't know, and it's too bad to be hacked or addicted to social media.
Nowadays, the important thing that the countries want is to have a developed country. The UAE is one of these countries that develop every day. It is ranked as the most popular country around the world because of the developments that they own. In this essay, I will discuss  the most important developments in the UAE at this time and my opinion about them. There are a lot of developments in the UAE, but the most important development that affects the country in a positive way is having  technology in the first place. For instance, using the technology for studying. As a result, the students will learn in several ways by using technology. On the other hand, it also has bad effects on children because they are using it to play all the time instead of learning new helpful things that might help them in the future. Generally speaking, technology is the most important development in the UAE these days, and it also has positive and negative effects. It seems to me that all the developments that happened recently in the UAE are important, but the technology might be one of the important developments, and I believe that every day, the UAE is coming with something new that will let the country be in the first place, now and in the future.
Social media can affect  people in many ways, both negatively and positively. For most people, opening social media is a daily habit; some people even open it on an hourly basis, while for me, I used to open social media every couple of minutes; now, I just don't seem to care about it as much as I used to.  Some of the positive things I mentioned about social media earlier are  like you can stay in contact with the world and see what's happening in the world, like for example, knowing what movie,  series or album just got released or knowing the news.  Another major positive point about social media is that some apps, like Instagram,  Pinterest, etc., give artists, authors and comedians a platform to perform on, and it can also give normal people, like you and me, a place to express how we feel and to see the world from a different perspective; at one minute, you can   see football news, like what player joined what club, and another moment, you see a time-lapse of a street artist drawing. While I do have a lot of things to say about social media, not all are positive; there is a negative side to social media; like it builds a bad habit and a sort of  addiction for us. We, as humans, feel the need to know what our friends are eating, where they are  going and what they are  doing, and that is when, in my opinion, I feel like it is too much;  it's nice to know stuff, but you don't have to know everything all the time. When you post a lot on social media, and a lot of people view it, it's like you don't have privacy anymore because everyone sees everything you do.
Nowadays, social media is important in the world; there are  many effects on individuals and society. Social media is dangerous for persons. Firstly, social media can take a person away from people; that means when the person focuses  on something in the social media, they don't care about time. Secondly, they don't care about family; if the family wants help, they don't want to help. Social media affects the society. Social media now affects the family. That means before, everyone was  talking, and we were going to see the family, but now,  nobody is talking; everyone is on social media. To sum up, we should have a plan to organize our time. In my opinion, the family should see their child.
Social media does affect our society in many ways. There  must  be an advantage and a disadvantage in everything.  Social media has many ways to affect you in a good way or a bad way. One of the most popular opinions that everyone knows is that social media became an important thing to communicate with each other and to know the news; in addition to this, social media affects our life in many ways; one of them is that we waste a lot of time sitting on our laptop. On the other hand, there are many advantages to using social media; they are that we can communicate with the others faster, and you can save time, like through online shopping to finish what you want without going outside the home and being worried about being so tired of going outside for hours. Social media cannot  affect you if you are using it right and making time for it. Social media must affect your kid so easily; hence, I suggest that you look after your kid very much. There are many mistakes that we made on social media; like many people put their own information on their account, and we can figure out their location, and that will cost maybe a life, so we should be so careful about the things we put  online. There are a lot of accounts that have been hacked, so people should be responsible for updating their password, or you can download an application that's called antivirus.
People affect in a lot of things faster, and the big example is the phone and social media. Let's talk about how social media affects the person individuals; social media is another and a huge word for it, and sometimes  it kills people, whereas it's not a person. There is a story about a boy that  killed  himself because of the bullying at school; he is a normal boy, and on some day, he logged in to Twitter and he saw a lot of people laughing on him. Social media makes people think that everything  is many, and it makes the children more angry and selfish. However, social media doesn't just affect individuals, it also affects the society. In this case, all the people and the world begin to be more aggressive. If the government or the responsible people don't solve the problem now, I think, and I know that the world will be a disaster. They should  figure the problem and work on it as possible as they can. It just needs some time so people know that they encourage and believe in a range of people or a range of celebrities,  but not all of them are the same; some of them are very good.
I think that social media has a huge impact on all people around the world, generally; it has affected people in a lot of ways - mentally, physically, etc... In my opinion, social media has affected the people in a bad way, and it became the most powerful thing that you can't stop. It became so addictive that  some things could not be  true, and people still believe them; and it can affect a lot of people mentally and physically; for example, people commit suicide and kill themselves, just because of some stupid comments, and a lot of people have no future or no hope and lost their dreams because of it.  These things have been happening for a while now, and people still can't  leave it because it is, as I said,  a huge part of our life, and it will never go away. So as the social media affected the individuals, it has affected the society  by making it become more lazy and   have no achievements and goals; it made them focus on the people who lost their lives, not on making the world a better place and making it go forward. Also, it is the main thing that is making the tension and arguments between families and friends; but in the end, I hope that the social media becomes more helpful and more of a resting place to make people work hard and achieve more in the future.
As we know,   nowadays no one can live without social media;  social media now  means everything to us; we can't do anything without social media; even also social media was a business for the famous people. In addition, on social media,  a lot of people become famous even if they do nothing in their account; only they post their daily routine, and they become famous. But we must know that there are advantages and disadvantages for social media, and it depends on how the people use the social media; if they use it in a wrong way, it will affect them in a bad way, and it will affect the society as well. Maybe  there are some who don't know much about the social media, and they start to use social media, but in a bad way. The question is why do they start to use social media in a bad way?  It's because no one tells them the correct way of how to use social media, so they don't have much information on how to use social media; so I prefer that there always must be a person who always tells the people how to use the social media in a correct way so there will be no social media problems in the community.
  Nowadays, the UAE is one of the developed countries in the world; Dubai is a city in the UAE that everybody  around the world knows. This essay will discuss the most important developments in the UAE. Firstly, education. In the last 50 years, the education has been developed due to the union of the Emirates, and it became one of the strongest educations in the Middle East, and the schools are training the students for the university life so they know everything;  even more, the technology is used at the school to teach the children in  different ways. Secondly, technology. For example, before the union, the UAE was a desert, and the people were using camels to go from place to place, but after the union, people have had cars for transportation. Thirdly, buildings are everywhere  in the country, specially Dubai, because it has the tallest building in the world - Burj Khalifa - and more other artificial buildings. Finally, health. Nowadays, the UAE has  really good hospitals and clinics that have really good doctors,  nurses and technology. To sum up, the UAE is a really good country that offers  the people a good education,  hospitals and a good living condition.
Nowadays, there are many social media that enable us to connect with people from all over the world, such as Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp, useful ones and harmful ones, and this depends on how we use them. The negative effect of social media is when the persons are addicted to it and waste all their time on these programs. Also, they stay alone and never sit with their families or friends. On the other hand, there are many positive effects, like learning new skills and cultures from other people and from different places. In addition, if someone has traveled to another place to study or work, they can communicate with family and friends through these programs. These are some of the social media effects, and I hope that you use it in a good way and learn many new things that help you in your life and in the future.
Nowadays, social media became more popular around the world, especially in the UAE;  it has affected the society in good and bad ways.  First of all, social media makes everything   easier than before. Secondly, it's easy to communicate with others and send a picture or video over WhatsApp,  email, Twitter and Snapchat, and there are a lot of  programs. It affects the students' grades. For example, if the student wants some help from her teacher or friend, she can text her and get the help in minutes. Another thing on the social media we found a lot is that if creative people  do some project, and they share it on social media programs, then they will get some comments. However, social media is developing the countries because a lot of people  start reading and knowing what is happening around the world. On the other side, there are some bad things about social media. First,  it makes people sometimes  angry with some comments.  Second, some people like to abuse others and say bad words to others. Also, they think it makes them cool. Another thing about social media is that there is a group of people who like to do cyberbullying against others. Also,  they're stealing, and they use them; that  affects the society in a bad way, which means the fight will increase, and people will become more aggressive.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has opened a lot of doors to our society; some are bad, and some are good. In many cases, social media has shown that it has a bad toll on teenagers and young students. Although social media has a lot of good effects on the society and the individuals, I believe that social media is a sword with two sharp ends. If you use it correctly and mindfully, you will decrease those bad effects, but in our case here and our society, and per my views on this topic, I believe that social media took a really big bad toll on us as a society and as individuals. That's why I would like to focus on the bad aspects of social media and its effects. First of all, social media has zoned out teenagers from their surroundings, and you can see that when they're on the phone and somebody tries to talk to them. It has dropped down all or most of the actual or physical social interactions with normal human beings sitting beside them, to an extent where it became weird if no one stared at their phone. Secondly, it became more of a hazard while driving, so it can now kill you instead of just having bad effects. Thirdly, there are many studies that show that there are bad psychological effects of handing youngsters phones and social media accounts at such a young age. At the end, I believe that a supportive and careful family must overlook or supervise all social media activity to decrease or weaken those bad effects on our future generations.
The UAE is the place of the life,  peace and culture.  However, at the moment, the UAE government is focusing on Expo 2020  because  it will make all the people around the world come to see this huge event and how this small country   is huge now.  In addition, it will make the economy of the UAE rise up and challenge the modern countries,  and it will open several jobs for the citizens  because the wheel of the economy will start moving because there will be many people in the UAE from different countries.  However, some locals ask, """How" will Expo 2020  affect  "us?"";" the more people come to the UAE the more we have more money  because the rich people will come to open their own projects here in the UAE,  and that will make the government have more money from them through the taxes and many things,  and the government will make the life for the locals  easier and  happier. The UAE will be always the best country to start a new life  in.
The social media is one of the most affecting things in these days.  Social media has changed our world in a huge way. Some of the people in these days, from different ages and different nationalities, use social media as a job or a way of living. Social media has opened a whole of new opportunities for most of the people. Maybe you can't succeed in your studies, but you can succeed in providing a nice contact for the viewers. Social media is affecting all the people in multiple ways. You can see the news,  football games,  funny videos or  anything you would like to watch. Social media is controlling a lot of things in these days. In the past, reaching other persons from other countries wasn't easy, but now you can do it in a few seconds by just pressing one button. Most of the people these days believe the social media more than what happens in front of their sight. Most of the news that people publish is rumors. Social media has positive sides and negative sides in that it could harm some people, and it could be useful to others.  From my point of view, not all ages can use the social media freely.  All of the kids should use the social media with their parents watching.
The most important development in the UAE at this moment is building the new Expo 2020; it brings the UAE to  the spotlight. From this development, it will raise new companies and new businesses, and it's going to improve the economy for the UAE. The Expo will be in Dubai and controlled by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, the ruler of Dubai. The project started in 2017 and, of course, being the first time that Expo starts in the Middle East; it's a big deal. All the new companies and businesses will come and gather in one place; it can be crowded, and so they will build a big campus with new structures and new hotels that can carry the guests with the design   of the future in mind. Also, the new tallest building, Burj Khalifa, will be finished, and it will be the tallest building in the world. This will make Dubai the best place for tourist attraction and make the economy and the country's vision much  greater. In conclusion, I think that Expo 2020 and Dubai will bring important development to the UAE.
The world has a big development in this year. The UAE government makes the first step to Mars and sends two Emiratis to Mars. In this year, the UAE makes a lot of achievements in the world, but this achievement will make a big development in the UAE government; they will look up to the future,  create their own spaceship and move to the space, and it's one of the first countries to move to Mars. The UAE government and the people will change; they will trade from Earth to Mars in this year;  the trade of the country will get increased, and the life will change in the UAE after the big development they made, moving to Mars. The UAE is one of the first countries to make this step,  choose Mars,  make it their next destination and discover what's inside this planet and if it's good to live there.
Social media gives our community a huge effect.  First of all, we will talk about this subject, in general.  Nowadays, all of the community ages are using social media,  children,  teenagers,  women,  elderly and even the babies.  There are a lot of things and apps  we can use,  look and search on these apps by phones,  laptops and even computers,  like Instagram,  Twitter,   Snapchat,  WhatsApp,   Telegram  and a lot of apps.  Did we think about the dangers of this social media?  And how can we keep our children  safe from these apps?  How can these phones affect  our bodies and our brains?  These apps can kill us and kill our community.  Cairo University said that we can avoid this problem by using them in organization  and giving our children some advice to avoid effects and the dangerous apps.  We can use our phones for 2-4   hours daily;  more than that can make us very lazy.  On the other hand, there are some positive points that  can be useful from the social media.  For example, if you want to learn a new language, you can study it on YouTube or Google.  If you are looking for a research,  Safari can help you;  so in a general way,  there are advantages and disadvantages,  but using this social media [INCOMPLETE]
The UAE in the past few years has had a good development in all the magazines, so if we will say about the achievements,   the world will know about them; but from 2009 to 2019, there have been many changes; it helps  to see the beautiful country, like Dubai - what will the people know about it? Some of them will say Burj Khalifa or Expo - that's it, but they do not know about the other things, like the City Walk, JBR,   City Sea and more; they will love it,  will  enjoy it and will tell their family or friends; so we finish Dubai, so we will start with the capital city, Abu Dhabi; it is my lively city; I love it; I  do not know why, but I love it maybe because I know it more than other cities; so  we may say, in 1999 and 2010, it did not have  big big changes - not like Dubai, but there are things;  but from 2011 to now, it's been better;  we have Yas  Waterworld,  Yas Mall and Yas Arena, so the UAE is the most beautiful country; I see that it's better than the past, and I hope it will be better, and we will see.
Emotional impact People use social media for many things, such as socializing, finding and sharing.  Social media has positive effects on our life, like sharing information with the people,  learning about the world,  getting information from Google, shopping and simply as a diversion. These are just a few of the ways that social media can improve people's lives. On the other hand, social media can cause stress and other negative emotions, like [INCOMPLETE]
The developments in the UAE at the moment In 2020, there are a lot of developments for the humans' life and the future, and what I  think is the most important development in the UAE at the moment is Expo Dubai 2020. Three points are the most important developments in the UAE; they are  Expo 2020, technology and flying out of the universe. There are positives and negatives between them all. First of all, in Expo 2020, there  are positives and negatives; the positive is that a lot of the people around the world will come to the Expo 2020; the negative is the difficult control by the police station in Expo 2020. The second one is technology. The technology also has  positive things and negatives; the positive is that it will make the people more intelligent for the future. The negative is that if the people play too much with those technologies, they are too dangerous for the future. The third one is flying out the universe; this also has positives and negatives; the positive is to look at what's outside the world and what we should make in the future. The negatives are too dangerous for the humans. In conclusion, in my opinion,  the most important development in the UAE at the moment is technology; it is the best future for the humans' life.
Social media is the most important for people to be in touch with their families, friends and others. Children are using it much more than the older people and have more ideas to make something new. The problem of the social media is not using it properly, for example, playing online and hacking other computers and phones. In our country, the police have made a social media policy, so if someone hacked your account or your laptop, they can find who  the hacker was and take the hacker to the court. Social media is much easier than in the past. You can send your presentations and photos. The people are inventing new applications and studying them well before they publish them to the world. For example, the scanner is an application that could scan the paper with the camera and automatically change it to PDF, so this is much easier than getting a copy with the printer. The people have to use the Internet properly and get their work done. In Emirates, there have been some problems with an application named Snapchat. Some of the users have not been using it the proper way. 
The social media has a lot of effects and good things on the people.  In the past, they didn't use social media; but now, because they have a lot of apps to use,  there are too many people who are famous, they have  fun and they see the new news on the Internet,  people are addicted to the social media, where everything comes on one screen. There are a lot of effects, first on the eyes. The society should read and write   a book  away from the phone.  People sure have fun   doing something on the phone.
I think the most important development in the UAE is technology  because it is the  thing that mostly helps you to connect with the others wherever  they are in the current time.  Also, we can see how our ministries focus on this part;  they try to make everything  include technology, such as education.  On the other hand,  using technology makes everything  easier; for example, you can contact with anyone quickly; also, you can know the news of the world using your cellphones. Currently,  our country, specially our president,  for example, HH Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid,  is trying to develop every ministry by using the technology to make life easier for us,  so this kind of development can make the country or society at a high level of development. I,  as a student,  can talk especially about education and how the technology helps us to study;  it helps us to contact with our teachers and makes the relation between us better.
Today, I will discuss a problem of how  social media affects individuals and society. Some people expect it's a small problem, but it's not. First, the social media published a new bad culture for the country. Secondly, it will be difficult for young people to deal with old people because of the lack of communication with them. Thirdly, one of the social media effects is that it preoccupies young people from studying. They will get a lot of time to play or speak with their friends on social media, and maybe they like dating on social media. There are some people who expect communication sites to be useful in some ways - one way is to get many friends in many countries. On the other hand, they may meet bad people and learn bad habits. In my opinion, social media has big problems for people and children. 
First of all, social media affects individuals and society positively and negatively. It depends on the individual or the society to decide  which side its effect will be on. The actions, ideas and behaviours determine the effect of the social media. For example, some societies function on social media to share some reading stuff, fundraisers and sport events. For individuals, they can share their own thoughts, but without hate or invading other people's privacy. Individuals might represent their own societies or countries, so they have to follow the previous examples and go way better to show the positive effect of social media. Second, the negative effect of social media could be shown in many ways. As mentioned previously, it depends on the individual and the society's actions, ideas and behaviours to limit the effect. For instance,  blackmailing is one of the most committed crimes via social media. These crimes committed by ones who think bad of social media and want to share hate among people on social media. Some individuals use social media applications to distribute false news. For example, a reporter is looking to get paid extra money by spreading rumors on social media, and some other reporters do the same, just to get more attention. In conclusion, social media could have both effects: positive and negative. People who are using or functioning on social media can decide whether they are going to get the good effect or the bad one.
Social media is the most popular way to connect with other people these days  because of the Internet and the new smartphones, where   everyone and every house got at least one smartphone.   The social media has two sides, like every other thing in the world; a good side and a bad side. The good side is that social media made our life easier to communicate with other family members and friends and also to make new friends through some apps online; and sometimes, you can learn from other people their experiences and mistakes so you can avoid them and carry on. On the other side, the social media can be a dangerous weapon if you didn't use it correctly; like if you put your personal information or pictures, that will be easier for hackers to take your credit card or your home address. Some people use the social media a lot,  stay late at night, are  late to work or, sometimes, never show because they didn't sleep at night, and that is one of many bad things when you use the social media in a bad way; and few of them, because of the social media,  don't like to meet others and just connect with them through the Internet. 
What do you think are the most important developments in the UAE at the moment?  In my opinion, there are many important developments in the UAE; the more important is that Expo 2020 is coming soon; and one of the most important development is Khalifa SAT; it's the first satellite created and launched in the UAE; it was created by the finest mind in the UAE;  and there are some other developments that are interesting, and one of the developments is """Berwaz" "Dubai"";" it has the most interesting innovations and technology; it's located in between old Dubai and new Dubai; it has an amazing view; you can see both  Dubais and see how Dubai has improved in the last 20 years; and if you visited """Berwaz" "Dubai,""" you will see the glass path; it's scary because you will feel that you are walking on air; it sounds crazy, but it seems that way;  and  another development is the most important development that happened in the UAE, where  Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan, may he rest in peace, turned the UAE from a place you can't plant or grow a single flower into a place that is famous for palms and a place that produces dates; and His Highness opened the first girls school and the first hospital; he changed the UAE from a desert to a place many people visit;   and when they found oil, it was a big move for the Middle Eastern region; they started to import and export oil, so the income has become high; so this is my opinion on what  the most important development is.
Social media is used by so many individuals. It has affected individuals and society positively and negatively. However, sometimes, social media can be unharmful, but the way you use it affects you drastically. Social media may affect you physically, mentally and socially. It can either be a positive effect or a negative effect. YouTube is used mostly by kids and teenagers, who are the most vulnerable in society. It displays all sorts of categories, like music, cooking shows, sports, kids shows, etc... YouTube is either healthy or unhealthy. Healthy means there are people who live a healthy lifestyle that you may get influenced by, and unhealthy means there are people who constantly eat junk food and live an unhealthy lifestyle, which also might affect you. Constant unhealthy eating lifestyle is very popular on YouTube; it is called """Muckbang""." Mentally being affected by social media is the worst type of effect on individuals and society. It mostly has a negative effect. You can get bullied in all sorts of ways. People might bully you because of your face, style, race, accent and basically everything. Social media is known as the place where individuals get mental illnesses. You can be affected due to the simplest things. However, you can also become mentally happy and stable due to the positive people you have surrounding you on social media, which is unlikely to happen. Being socially affected means you may either be very addicted to social media - which may lead you to avoid other individuals in reality - or use social media to contact individuals to meet in reality. However, people mostly get affected negatively, which leaves people with no contact. In conclusion, social media is good and very educational only if you use it correctly.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media   nowadays has a great impact on our daily lives; we spend the majority of our day sitting on our phones posting stuff and watching others' posts, and that made us get away from people in real life and talk to people on the social media instead.  When you think of the social media, you think of the younger generations because they are the people most affected  by it; caring about the looks, fashion, gaming and other stuff is all the things younger generations like to do, and social media provides them with what they want to see. People create a life for themselves on the social media, and they can also become famous because of what they post every day, and they show people that their life is perfect and that they are happy every day; and by  watching them, people may feel empty and wish that their lives could be like theirs.  Many teenagers have had depression from watching people's lives on social media because seeing others' lives being so perfect while yours is not  will make you hate your life and not to accept it. Social media can also be so dangerous for children because there are people on the social media that make fake accounts to seduce kids,  and that is a major effect for the [INCOMPLETE]
These days, having a smart device is essential because with that, you can keep up with what's happening all around the world and communicate with people from the other side of the globe, and it's actually hard to live in the 21st century without having a social media account. Social media has a huge effect on society, whether it's negative or positive. Let's look at the positive sides of social media. Since almost everyone has a social media account, you can contact your friend and share photos with them through social media platforms, and, also, it's easier for celebrities to communicate with their fans; also, you can share and look for much helpful information and researches posted on social media platforms, but there are negative sides, such as certain rumors that cause arguments on social media or influencers who support the wrong side, while some people would be against it. Some would follow their wrongdoings, especially kids since they tend to copy elders the most. One very important negative side of social media for individuals is losing confidence after looking at a comment that puts you down, which gets you low  self-esteem. As individuals of society, we should encourage more people about the right use of social media.
The UAE is  home to many people, most of whom are not from here. There are so many more immigrants and settlers in the UAE than there are locals; this means that there are people from different backgrounds, cultures and religions. The UAE's citizens must show respect, acceptance and tolerance towards all individuals as people have the right to express themselves. There are so many ways the UAE could promote tolerance; one way they could do that is by starting events, specifically to introduce people to different cultures; people could attend and learn about cultures. Being able to be tolerant towards everyone means you cannot be ignorant. People need to be educated to understand that it's okay if people were different from them. Since the UAE is a Muslim country, it is especially important for people to promote tolerance here. Islam is all about peace and tolerating people of different religions and ethnic backgrounds.
Using social media increased gradually within most of the societies. There are both positive and negative impacts of using social media on individuals. Nowadays, societies and people are using social media to communicate easily with people around the world. I believe that teenagers are the  people using social media  the most, the way they use it in their free time to free up their stress from school or university work. Parents before were nervous about why their child plays video games, but now everything has changed, and the Internet showed up, and they are more worried. Firstly, social media allows individuals to easily look at what is going around them by entering, for example, the Instagram app and looking up breaking news; or he/she is interested in fashion, so they look up the category of fashion and see what is new in the shops - maybe it is their taste and so on. Secondly, social media made it easy to communicate with people all around the world by using the developed app; in addition, social media allows people to learn and understand different countries' cultures that are  interesting to him/her. Learning about different cultures allows individuals to enhance their knowledge and be familiar with different countries' culture. Learning new stuff allows the individual to give better opinions in different sectors within his own country and develop countries' economics, hospitality,  etc... Thirdly, In my opinion, using social media in your free time is much better than sitting and doing nothing because the brain must have an activity going on and brainstorm things surrounding the person. In conclusion, social media has a great impact on our daily life usage because life has changed, and the population increased exponentially, so social media made it easy to communicate with different people all around the world.
a) In my personal opinion, the UAE already promotes a culture of tolerance by having a spectrum of cultures mixed together. The UAE is one of the most diverse places I know; I grew up in an environment where I learned tolerance and acceptance from a young age. Tolerance and acceptance  are two of the side effects of growing up in a diverse culture and society and being born into a world full of different faces, backgrounds and races. Learning to love all and tolerate all comes easy in a place like the UAE, and I've never been  prouder to call a place home. Everyone in the world can become more tolerable; there is no place that has achieved maximum tolerance, but it is a significant place, where the UAE is starting on its path of tolerance.
The UAE is one of the most constantly changing and developing countries in the world. Whether it is a social, academic or constructional development, the UAE will most probably be developing and eventually excelling at it. It is an accepting country with a diverse range of people living in it. I personally think that the most important developments in the UAE are the ones that involve the society because, no matter how amazing the schooling is or how luxurious the destination might be. If the society is not loving and accepting towards one another, then it would not have as many tourists as it would if it was. The tolerance movement in the UAE has helped the society become more familiar with one another, and it resulted in the tourism  spike. The UAE hand signal  (Peace, Love and Victory)  has designed a nation that is known for its peace and serenity with different cultures and ethnicities. The tourism in the UAE would not be so successful if the society was not so loving. If the UAE did not have as much luxury as it does now, but the society was just as amazing, then I can guarantee you that tourism would not have been affected because we have other things to offer (culture,  pearl-diving market, fish market, agriculture, gold and diversity). So in conclusion, the most important developments in the UAE are the societal developments because they control most of the UAE's success.
Social media has a huge impact on society and individuals, especially in the current generation, and it has become  essential in our daily lives.  Social media has its advantages and disadvantages; it either can benefit the person or harm them, but one of the advantages of social media is that it is  a very entertaining tool when you're bored and don't have anything to do, but  social media may motivate the person to work hard and study because social media contains many motivational pages to push the person to work hard, and social media will  help the person develop social skills because of the interactions that occur while using social media; but in the other hand, there are many disadvantages of social media; like the excess usage of social media will result in many health problems, such as the loss of  eyesight and complications in the brain; and another disadvantage is the loss of  self-esteem that is caused by cyberbullying; and as  students, we might stay on social media all day and forget to study, which will result in the decrease of the grades.  In my opinion, as much as social media is important to our lives, we should restrict ourselves to a couple of hours a day because using it too much can cause many serious health problems.
In a world of change, a world of continuous ongoing movements, technology has prospered to reach levels never reached before. It consumes our daily habits, routines and ways of living. Though it proved to be a tool that guides humanity towards a promising future, it does come with its own drawbacks and negativities. One of its branches being the media has tremendously changed throughout the years as it started from the radios to televisions to phones to, nowadays,  give a voice to those unheard, whether it is through awareness of minorities or promoting ideas with the power of affecting fractions of the world at once. Social media has provided the chance of connecting between individuals, societies, countries and cultures. Though these connections proved to be an amazing way of eliminating barriers, it also gave chances to those spreading malice to affect larger groups of individuals at once. A simple message spouting ideas could be read by millions and causes them to either be affected positively or negatively. The simplest of examples would be those individuals with a strong attachment to the environment; they would use social media to spread awareness at a greater scale across the world to make people see what the world is coming to and what they could do to stop it; but not everyone has such good motives, for some would try to encourage everyone to break the law and wreak havoc simply because they have the power to do so. Social media is a powerful yet dangerous place, for it attracts those with weak spirits to its entrances with disguises of wealth and happiness. Those thinking that wealth is equated with power would find themselves stealing, pretending and faking, just to get the satisfaction of receiving other people's envy and supposed respect. It is a  never-ending cycle of observing, communicating and giving back. It is up to us to decide if we would use it to make our world a better place or participate in the event of bringing it to its ultimate doom.
Social media nowadays affects so many individuals and society today; however, many wonder why  it affects so many people. Social media today are websites and applications, like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and many other social media platforms. Society uses social media as a platform to reach people all around the world; it's easier to connect with people through social media cause it represents who you are as an individual through the things you share online. So many musicians and actors use social media to advertise their work rather than magazines and TV appearances cause it's one click away. Many individuals also use social media as a career. Regular people have jobs as influencers because of social media because of the followers they have and the influence they have on people online from all around the world. They start using it as a way to get paid and do advertisements on Instagram or any other social media platform. Society gets affected by people on social media or the person they can be - with the help of the Internet, you can be anything. People are affected by social media cause it's a gateway to not being yourself and not showing everything about you; you filter away your personality and show the people what you want to show about you rather than everything. I believe that social media affects people in a good way, although many get lost from the real world by using it; others find themselves with the help of social media. You could make millions of dollars now with social media; you can be a creator and an entertainer with the use of the Internet. You can also forget about the real world and the problems you face by watching the entertainers and creators on social media.
Social media is important in our world now; like I mean it's so important; we do use it for everything in our life, and it does have a good way and a bad way in our environment. We  can  use it in a good way  by making ourselves better; like we study on it, or it helps us with our daily life or with our jobs, etc.  Social media is really helpful, but it also can damage a lot of people by making them addicted to it or by making them do things that lead them to a bad life that can change their life and thinking.  So social media has so much effect on our life, but we have to know how to use it and how to be careful of it;  like you need to know that social media is not your whole life that will give you everything you want. Social media helps you to do things easier; stop trusting people online so fast and giving everyone your private information, protect your phone and laptop from unknown websites and don't let social media control you - you control social media; and social media is not a bad thing, but you have to know how to use it and how to make it affect you in a good way only. 
During this era, most of the people are using social media (all ages and genders).  Social media is what people can't live without nowadays. People are on social media all the time; it has a big effect on individuals and society; some of the effects are negative and some are positive.  The negative side is that they spend their whole time on social media, and some of the individuals are faking a personality that is totally different from their real one, just to seem cool in front of others, and people may share their personal information over there and just regret it later on. The positive effects are that people will be having new friends, and they may also have work on social media, like Instagram; they can do some advertising if they have followers; and people can also communicate with people they didn't see for years through social media. Social media is what made people know the trends and everything new; it affects the society in a good way because    people will know about everything new that happens without searching for it. Social media made our lives much easier because you can do and find everything you need through it.
Social media affects individuals and society a lot because a lot of people copy them if they did something like wearing some revealing clothes or did something illegal. People should know that not everything social media people do they must do  too because it may affect them in the end. Some children also get affected by them because they watch what the social media people do and then do the same even though it may affect them in the end or destroy their lives. Moreover, people should not copycat  others because it's wrong, and maybe it will change them into a new character, which will affect their life skills and other things. Some families don't want that to happen to their children because they may do some wrong things, and it will be too late to change or correct the mistake they did. A lot of girls that are at age 12 put makeup  these days because they saw some famous people on YouTube that did the same and taught them to do it; in the end, it will affect them because they are still young for that, and they should not play with these things at all. I believe that social media will affect  society and individuals in the end because it causes a lot of problems in some people's life.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has a huge effect  on children and adults and on our society, in general. In many different ways, it can affect you through the person you like or the person that influences you by doing a certain action. It can make the society change with one video posted on the Internet or on social media. It can make you a bad person if you were influenced by the wrong people that might have bad actions - this is for an individual,  a teenager or even a child, while for a society, it can make you go to jail for one irresponsible action that can lead to a crime; and if children are used to having crimes all the time around them, then it will be normal for them to commit one and to have illegal behavior. Second but not last, in our generation and for our kids and society, it's bad to get influenced by anyone because people have different opinions and ideas, which leads to many different actions and thoughts that can make you act differently. Last but not least, people have different opinions on many things, so you just have to do what you think is the best for you.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media is a big world that's hidden in our devices. This big world has many effects on people that we don't actually realize; there are positive and negative effects on individuals and on the society. Social media can be very harmful that people reach the level of suicide, and that's due to the bullying and shaming it brings to people; and some people on social media hide their identity to do illegal activities. Addiction to social media is a big issue, specially nowadays, where even children have devices and can access social media. On this side of the topic, there are endless positive and negative outcomes, like pulling people away from their families and friends yet keeping them in touch only through social media. The only connection to their families who live in the same building can only be through social media, and that causes people to be in a hole all by themselves with their devices and not see the actual real world. However, there are still a few positive outcomes. Social media can connect you to people from other countries and let you meet new people, which actually helps people who are  antisocial, but too much of it can make you  antisocial if you're not. It can also pave a way to bringing new ideas or giving your thoughts and opinions on situations to the public. Businesses even use social media; in fact, it's probably the best way to advertise since you're just a touch away from the whole world. I personally use social media a lot, but I try managing or balancing my time with the outside, and I feel like that's the best way nowadays since social media is a huge part of our day-to-day   lives.
Social media has been one of the most popular ways of communicating lately, especially in this generation. Many people are fond of social media and applaud it, but how does social media really affect the society? Almost everyone in this generation uses social media, but many people actually think that social media has a bad effect on the society; why? Well, let me list a few reasons. One of the most common reasons why social media has a negative effect on the society is that people get easily addicted to it, and once they are addicted, they have no interaction with the outer world whatsoever. You might think that it is only the younger generation that is addicted to social media, but in reality, the older generation is also addicted to social media. Do you notice how many people do not have a gathering to chat anymore? That is because they think it is better to just communicate with one another while they are relaxed. Now, as much as that is true, people still need to communicate with each other every once in a while. Another negative effect that social media has on society is that many people tend to get bullied through social media; therefore, they have low  self-esteem and confidence. Many kids also get addicted to social media and start getting hostile if they are taken away from it and may start getting low grades. I do think that social media is a great way to communicate with one another, but it has to be used in the correct way rather than being sunken into the social media community and becoming addicted to it.
Social media affected the lives of people; some believe it affected them negatively, while others believe that it changed their lives for the better. I believe that social media will be one of the reasons  why people will stop being social. Opinions differ, but I believe that the mindsets  of people, because of social media, began to change, and all that people care about is popularity. Social media is one way for people to get together and communicate with one another, but it also can destroy one's life in a matter of seconds. Teenagers, specifically, can easily get scammed and catfished; and not only that, but children of all ages are bullied on social media, which can negatively affect their lives. Because of social media, people would sit at home all day browsing through different applications rather than going to the mall. This would not only affect their lifestyle but would also affect their health. Laziness is one main effect, and another is  eyesight problems. One of the main reasons  why a large amount of people wear glasses is that they spend their quality time on their phones. In conclusion, I believe that social media has a negative effect on our society and that people should consider using social media less even though it's an easy way to communicate with others.
The United Arab Emirates has a lot of new and modern developments that have improved the nation enormously. The following are some developments that I consider the most important in the UAE at the moment. In my opinion, the most important development in the United Arab Emirates at the moment is the awareness of people with determination. For a very long time, people with determination have been suffering from the lack of privileges and services, such as sports, art and many more. One of the great accomplishments of the UAE is helping the athletic people with determination by hosting the Special Olympics 2019 in Abu Dhabi, which helped spread awareness and show people that if any person could do this, people with determination can also do it. The UAE has helped people with determination a lot by offering facilities and services to the people with determination. Another thing that I consider an important development in the UAE at the moment is tolerance; no matter who you are. Where you are from doesn't matter - you are always welcome and respected. The tolerance of the Emirates' nation is a very important development as it welcomes people from all around the world. The year of tolerance is such a lovely reminder to remind the people of the basic principles of humanity.
Social media has taken everything in our life; they use it daily, and this has affected our daily life and our future. People have lots of social media, and people in this time love social media. I see in our daily time that most people use social media, and this affects us;   that's why in this generation, social media must be used less in our time, and a lot of people must contact with other people, specially family and friends. People in this generation have lost too much connection with their family because of social media, and they can't sit together because of that. Social media is a different universe in this world because it has affected our society and our life, and this will let us lose interest in seeing others. Social media made everything easy; that's why people loved it, and it's the best way that people could live;   that's why they should stop living the social media life and start seeing lots of people and contact with them so they can see the difference between social media and staying together. In conclusion, I think that they must stop social media so they can see the difference they have in their life instead of sitting and chatting on their phones.
In the last decade, we were introduced to the newest technology that has completely changed our lives, both negatively and positively. Social media has made life so much easier from many aspects; it made it easier for people to communicate and for people to study from many sources and made entertainment available right at our homes. On the other hand, a lot of people misused social media. Teenagers and children have been provided with  smartphones and other types of devices, and there is no limit   to their use. Social media consumed the lives of many. Problems like losing confidence, lack of sleep, losing temper, loss of memory and becoming less social as well as being dependent all   can be prevented if parents were  stricter about how long their children use social media. Allowing them only to use it for 2-4 hours instead of 8 hours can make a huge behavioral and social difference in the children's characteristics. Not only children can be affected by social media but also adults. Older women and men can face many issues with themselves, especially women who tend to wander on social media,  browse other women's pages and start lowering their self-esteem by comparing their own bodies and occupations to those of other women. There are men all over the world working to support their families financially, but there are men that overwork to provide their family with more than enough and forget the importance of bonding; they will keep taking phone calls and emails even when they're back home and never spend crucial time with their loved ones. All in all, social media can be really useful and help you in many ways - but only if you use it the right way, and it can be harmful if you use it the wrong way.
Social media is something that's so important in our generation, like Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat and WhatsApp. People use it for different reasons. Social media has many positive things and negative things. Life would be hard without social media - I mean hard because social media makes things simple and easier to be done, like advertising some products and making new friends from different countries around the world. Some people use it in the wrong way; they share their personal things that shouldn't be shared with others. Some people post their pictures and selfies, then they get bullied by others, and other people use those pictures for other things, and it affects the person; and some of them befriend people that they shouldn't be  friends with. It's really dangerous for kids, and social media shouldn't be used by kids; there are many things that they shouldn't know about, and, for sure, they learn the bad words from the things they watch and any other applications they use. Many famous people advertise for products that they don't really know about and  whether they're really good or anything, and the only thing they do this for is money.
Social media is the most used program in this century because it connects you with people all around the world, and you know the news and what's going on from one country to another; it also helps you promote your achievements so people can look at them and sometimes approach you with a job for your great achievement. The idea of social media is to make your life easier by making new friendships and knowing people, all around the world, and their different ethnicities and their background. Every society has its own idea of social media; some people in the society think social media can improve every individual by having their own personality. The effects have some bad influence and, at  the same time, a positive effect on the society by letting the kids learn from others by their good actions, and they can read news all over the world and learn that difference is a good idea, not a bad one. The bad thing is that it's so addicting and a waste of time when you use it in the wrong way. In the end, social media has improved the society in a good way all over the world, and that will make us very educated people and spread the good things to others and show them what's right from wrong.
Social media is a huge part of the world; the world uses social media as an easier way to communicate with each other. Most people use social media to interact with friends and family from the other part of the world. Furthermore, social media can be used to sell products that businesses  nowadays do for profit. More likely, social media is louder than people who speak (the media speaks louder); people can say things around the world freely. Firstly, social media was used to reach out to people around the world, yet it caused much trouble around the world; people started using it to bully others, and it caused a lot of depression to teenagers who use the Internet for fun. Moreover, social media created a cold war between people and between religions, which caused a lot of deaths in the past years. People end up committing crimes. Individuals became heartless. Secondly, it affected most teenagers'  self-confidence; teens spend their time browsing through the web, watching their favorite celebrities. Although most social media influencers use Photoshop to look good in photos, yet teenagers try to look like their favorite people. They end up going under the knife to look similar to these photoshopped people. In conclusion, social media has its pros and cons, but others use it wrong, and some use it to reach out to family or friends. People are affected by what they see;  teenagers use it as a fun way to waste time,  but they bully others, and some get depressed.
Social media has progressed through the years and is one of the most used platforms in the world; it can either have a positive impact on individuals and society or a negative one. First of all, one of the most useful things about social media is that it is one of the best ways to connect with family and meet new people who have the same interests as you. Moreover, news spread like fire on social media, which can be beneficial to individuals since it informs people about things like weather updates and what's happening around the world. Second of all, because social media has some useful things, it also has a negative impact, like cyberbullying, which can cause a person to be depressed or even commit suicide. Secondly, social media can be highly addictive because people are worried about their reputation and what others think of them, which can lead them to not being productive and having no privacy. In conclusion, social media can be beneficial if it was used in the right way, like communicating with family and friends and looking for updates  instead of cyberbullying and keeping no privacy to yourself.
As technology developed, social media took a huge part of our daily life. Social media is a very broad field; its content can be beneficial and non-beneficial. Social media includes applications, such as Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook,  etc. Social media affects individuals and societies in many ways that can be both good and bad. Each individual uses social media in a different way. Some people use social media to keep in touch with friends and family members that live far away. Some other people use social media to expose themselves to people from other cultures and expand their knowledge of any topic they desire. In such cases, social media has a positive effect on the individual. On the other hand, there are some people that follow up with popular figures on social media that promote wrong ideas and influence their thinking in a way that does not suit the mindset that they grew up with. Social media makes it easier for bullies to bully people without an identity; this can lead to many mental illnesses. Those examples illustrate how social media can affect an individual badly. A group of individuals makes up a society. Therefore, how does social media affect the individuals? It will affect the society as a whole. If the individuals used social media in a way that will add to them and inspire them to do more and to be better, the outcome will be a society full of positive energy, and that will make it develop and provide the next generations with a better future. However, if individuals abused social media in bad manners, it will only make the society go backward in all aspects, and that will affect their lives in a bad way. All in all, social media affects you, depending on the way you use it. Moreover, the acts of individuals make up the full image of society. Individuals are responsible for either developing the society or demolishing it.
In the past few years, the humanity has been in the process of development for its future and in order to make life simple for it and much easier for it; and one of the ways of development is the communication. In the last few years in the new generation, the iPads and such  devices have come out into this world to make life simple for us; communication is one of the new access humanity has gained from this development. People nowadays have learned how to use technology in order to communicate, and the social media apps have shown in the last few years, taking a big place in  humans' life. The social media has its positives and negatives, but, most importantly, it made communication around the world  simpler; yes, a lot of people are addicted, but it's unhealthy to waste your time on social media instead of doing real-life  activities. The social media didn't affect one country or a specific group of people; it did affect the whole globe and made it one community that shares their life moments and enjoys texting others, but that made the rumors spread faster around the world of false stuff, which caused troubles and made this community get toxic; and they only accept the things they think are fine and not what is really fine. In my personal opinion, I think that the social media is a weapon with two edges; it can be positively used for the good sake, and it can be used negatively to destroy lives and make people become depressed; it's not the fact of why we use it; it's how we use it.
How has social media affected people? It has affected people in a positive way and also in a negative way. There have been many side effects; people have struggled with depression, anxiety and other mental disorders due to social media. A teenage girl, the other day, posted on Twitter a vote asking if she should commit suicide or not. She sadly got more votes that she should kill herself; hours later, this young beautiful teenage girl took her life away. People on social media have played her (and also various  other people). Social media also has a positive impact on people; many people have started businesses. A couple of businesses that I know of have tremendously grown because of social media; they used those applications to advertise their business, and after that, it has been really successful, for example, Home Bakery; this woman has become an entrepreneur; she started selling cookies; she took orders through Instagram and posted pictures of her cookies. She started small, just by opening a page on Instagram; she eventually started getting famous and got a lot of orders. Now, she has a couple of coffee shops in Dubai, and she is a millionaire. Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and many other apps gave people the opportunity to be entrepreneurs - by selling clothing and food and filming their lifestyle - and also a chance to be famous. It really depends on how a person uses those applications. In my point of view, children shouldn't have any type of social media without an adult because they don't know  right from wrong, and they do get affected really quickly.
A garden in the desert The UAE is currently the leading country in surpassing past achievements and setting new standards for development, for even amidst the desert sand, a tree grew to then form a garden of it, shaping our society and culture to expect the unexpected. Furthermore, the UAE has broken down the walls to many barriers to being successful. Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan, the finest of all rulers, was able to build love in each citizen's heart, which then allowed him to use that love to better this spectacular country, for it's the steps he took that made each person take pride and want to take his country to the top ranks. So till this day, the people in the UAE still strive to accomplish the unaccomplished. For example, Masdar City is a city that uses no electricity; however, it uses solar energy in order to light up streets, buildings and even food trucks. Not only that, but the UAE has managed to break down borders built to put women down and managed to build towers that could lift women up. To add to that, the awareness found in the UAE is like no other, for, especially this year, the year of tolerance was named to help showcase a topic that's been discussed worldwide. Furthermore, the love built years ago by His Highness Sheikh Zayed still beats through each person's heart, making them proud yet still wanting more for this wonderful garden in the desert. In conclusion, no accomplishment will be the last  in this land of pride; nothing feels as if it's enough. Seven emirates beat with one heart, all running to win in this race of countries trying to surpass the others; but in the end, it is the country that finds itself building its pillars on a wise man's words and a nation with an open heart that's winning.
Social media plays a huge role in most people's lives, no matter how old or young. It has both negative and positive effects on individuals and  society. For some individuals, the use of social media is a means of communication between one another and a way to feel connected with the rest of the world. However, it sometimes becomes harmful to these individuals because they become addicted to this form of communication and disconnect themselves from the outside world. Social media has opened new doors for corruption in the society because individuals can commit crimes; whether it is theft or cyberbullying, they can do it anonymously, therefore allowing more and more people in the society to become corrupted. So the actions of these individuals on social media affects the society entirely, either positively or negatively.
Social media affects society and individuals in a variety of ways. Some are positive and have benefited the world greatly, serving in great ways to make life easier. Other ways are negative and have paved a path a lot say is one that leads to our future's destruction. Moreover, the positive effects of social media are countless. Social media has opened the gates to free communication - """free""" as in limitlessness at any time and place. Another pro is the fact that it has opened the doors to people's personal lives - everything is posted online. This is a great factor and comes in handy for companies and businesses because, knowing people's details, they can specifically target them with their advertisements. Furthermore, there are also many negative sides to social media. In fact, some may say the cons outweigh the pros. Social media has created a lack of human contact. This is due to it providing an easy way of online communication; hence, people have become lazy when it comes to face-to-face   interactions. Another major con is the emphasis it placed on the financial gaps between people in the world. Although these gaps existed before, people weren't as aware of them as they are now due to everyone's details being posted on a page. In a nutshell, social media has revolutionized the way the world works. It has benefited humans greatly, but also, it has become their biggest foe. With that being said, control is always in the hands of the user.
 Social media has taken a big place in our society; it has its advantages and its disadvantages. I'm going to be talking about the advantages and disadvantages of social media and how it affects our society. Social media has given us a very easy way to communicate and to stay close with people who are distant; it also made education a lot easier and simple. If you needed to study about a certain time, you can simply watch a movie that talks about ancient times. Social media has made education simpler, easier and, probably for most people, a lot more interesting. However, people are not controlling themselves and not using social media like  it should be used. People are using social media, which has led to a lot of negative results, like laziness, lack of communication skills, social media addiction and a lot more. Social media has made us a lot less active, which made a lot of people unhealthy. If social media addiction develops in the next few years, people are not going to be able to communicate and express their feelings to others, which makes life a lot less meaningful. I think social media is extremely effective and can have its positives and negatives, but the important thing is to use it in the right way.
Throughout  the years, a new generation has come carrying new things and new developments, and yet there is more to come. Social media is one of the things that has come to our world, society and minds; it took all of our attention throughout  the years. Social media made things easier for everybody. Social media reunited friends and family who are thousands of miles away as well as  lazy people. Social media has negative and positive points, like any other thing in this world. Social media impacted people in different ways; its negativities may hurt others mentally and physically. Some use the application in a bad way, but some aren't aware of that and how they use these applications, and by that, we mean elders and others.  Cyberbullying is the main negative point on social media; it made many people commit suicide in different ways, it made people stop their careers or stop eating like the way they are used to and much other stuff. It also has an impact on society, creating problems between countries and cities and much other stuff that we, the society, don't have anything to do  with.  Stealing information is something common that we see everywhere; the main cause of it is us, the users, posting our private information on any website or even application that can cause us to lose what we have. Hacking is the same way  stealing photos and credit card information which we aren't supposed to post  or save  anywhere on our devices and getting our personal information, such as our street or address, which leads to house stealing when this is another case to open. Posting plane tickets on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook or any other applications can lead us also to problems with our private information. People use this stuff  to show off to people or even maybe to have fun, and there's nothing fun about posting our personal information. People have to learn and know the wrong things that could happen with anything we use. As mentioned before, everything has negativity and positivity; that doesn't mean that social media is harmful to everybody; people who can use it and have the full knowledge about how to use it  won't find any problems. Use the social media carefully and don't post anything on it - it can come back to you and cause you more problems  than you think.
Social media is an application that we use to communicate with others and discover other cultures;  it's a double-sided weapon you either use  wisely or you just ruin your life by doing wrong choices.  Our generation has been creative and smart more than the past generation because they can access anything and everything easily;  they don't need to learn it as if they are born with the skills. As I said before, social media has opened our eyes to so many things;  you just need to teach your children where,  when and how to use the media, in general,  because some of them have used it wrong and destroyed their life and other people's life,  so either you tell them and punish them or don't be sad if the kids have become what you didn't expect.  Social media affects us individually; it makes us more like  lonely people with poor communication skills and scared of the outside,  and maybe depressed  for that matter.  There are many cases and diseases that have shown up since social media came to the world,  like  autism,  depression, etc...   We have to fix those diseases, for they kill us literally because, with the Internet and video games, some of those young people have killed each other for some dumb stuff.  In the other hand, on the level of society,  there are some dangers, and research has proven that the percentage of deaths and suicides has increased  over time,  and parents are not aware of the danger around them, and that affects their kids. Despite  the many many cons of social media, there are many benefits  because social media helped us with our lives,  work,  studies and knowledge, in general.  We have to make people aware of what they might face  or what could happen. 
Topic (C) Social media is an important part of our life because we use social media the whole day.  Social media affects everybody  because it influences people on how to live, how to act and how to even feel. This generation faces many problems because they watch bad influencers on Twitter or Snapchat, for example; kids or even teenagers did not live their life well because they always face bullying problems, and they think they are bigger than their age,  so that makes the community   destroyed, and people face many emotional problems. People do not see the real world; they just live the social media life.  Social media, on the other hand, may be good in some ways; it makes people connected and study better because you really can understand. That makes people feel the warmth and not feel alone; and if  something happened, you can reach out to the police through online apps or call them, and if you are facing problems, you can reach out to the person you want. That  sometimes makes the society connected and express its feelings about a problem or its thoughts. In conclusion, social media is good if people took it in a way that develops the society, and if not, it will destroy the society - it is in their hands.
Social media can affect each kind of person if he can't control himself. Social media could help the person;  in the other hand, social media could destroy the person. Each one of us today is using social media - adults, teenagers, kids, old men, etc. Nowadays, each kind of person is using social media daily (YouTube); they can see things that could help them in the future and help them in their studies and get a benefit from social media. In the other hand, they could watch things that could destroy them and end their life easily. Social media could affect the person individually by making them do stupid things, such as watching things that you don't need to watch (+18), thinking about things that you could not reach and watching people that  are above your level, and you could do  anything to reach  their level  (buying an expensive car).  These days in the UAE, KSA and randomly in our religion, each husband takes a video with his wife to be famous and have more money, and these kinds of things in our religion are not good. Kids will think in the future about taking videos with their wives. Also, on Instagram, each month, there are new challenges, such as the Bottle Challenge, the Plastic Bag Challenge, etc. These small things could affect the society and change its way of thinking. In conclusion, each person needs to be responsible for  himself; also, we need to watch our kids to see what they are sharing on social media or what they are watching. I hope that you've gotten my message and gotten  new information.
Social media is a  fast-growing platform   that is affecting individuals and society; hence, like everything, social media has its pros and cons. When it comes to these applications, people must be aware of their actions as these could have serious consequences. People like celebrities and influencers have major impacts on these platforms, which means they should be aware of what they upload, tweet, etc. For example, if someone has thousands or millions of followers and he/she uploads something wrong or inappropriate, they need to think about the number of people that are going to view this post and are going to be affected as they may idolize that particular person. In some cases, social media is an amazing way to promote worldwide problems, like countries suffering from poverty and war zones. Another great example of where social media has come in handy - and this happened recently - is when no one knew that the Amazon  rainforest was on fire, and not a single news outlet was reporting the problem. This news was so important as that exact  rainforest provides us with about 20% of our oxygen; without that and with us,  humans, releasing all these bad things into the air, we wouldn't all be around for much longer. Like everything else, social media has its positive and negative aspects, so it's up to that person to use it in the correct way.
Social media is a widely controversial subject with various opinions regarding its negative and positive aspects. While social media has many positive impacts on society, it can also imprint many negative changes on people worldwide. Social media is widely used as a means of communication between people. Social media lifts boundaries made by long distances and creates roads that can easily connect people to one another. However, if not used correctly, those roads can lead to dead ends and cause individuals more harm than good. As the use of social media increased, studies have shown a simultaneous increase of false information or news being shared by people. This can cause harm to societies due to the lack of trust between people. False information or rumors being spread can also stir alliances between countries. Also, bullying on the Internet has become much easier to do since it can be anonymously done. Since social media allows people to wear masks, it has been proven by psychology that it allows people to be more comfortable being harsh on others. This causes people to lose their lives and mental health due to bullying through social media. In conclusion, there are many positive and negative impacts of social media. Therefore, it is important to raise awareness on the dangers of social media to help limit the negative impacts it can cause to individuals and societies.
Nowadays, social media has become widespread and a crucial method of communication as it affects society and its members in various ways. First of all, since everyone has access to these social applications, they can be used to spread awareness. For example, when the Amazon rainforest was set on fire, many people started to spread awareness and set up donations for reforestation and to the indigenous people who lost their homes. This way, social media helped people save the environment and people's lands through crisis-aid  websites, such as Go Fund Me. Also, social media can be used for many educational purposes. Many academic websites make tests and provide knowledge or books to people around the world, thus improving people's analytical and thinking skills. Although there are many benefits to social media, spending too much time on it can cause psychological issues. For instance, many people who start blogs may get negative comments from others, which may sometimes lead to  self-hatred. Also, in extreme cases, the person may develop anxiety or depression. It is the best to use social media for the right purposes so everyone could live healthily and enjoy what these sites have to offer.
Centuries ago, communicating with others was very hard and complicated. Nowadays, we have technology and multiple ways to communicate with others, specially through various apps of social media. Social media has many advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it is used. Social media has a huge effect on individuals and societies as a whole. It helps families,  friends, etc., to communicate by using various apps, like Skype. On the other hand, social media has disadvantages as well that affect individuals and  society through bullying and spreading fake news that causes problems between different communities and even countries, which leads the society to fall apart. Social media has a huge impact on our daily lives; it allows us to follow up on daily news and follow other influencers for motivation, etc. Nowadays, we all use different types of social media for various reasons, and one of the most main reasons is to communicate with others to follow up with them, specially if there's a long distance between  us. In conclusion, social media is very important for the majority of our society and is very much used to communicate and to remain updated on various occasions to know what to expect in the next coming day, month, year, etc.
Social media is so important to people nowadays, and it has a huge effect on people and society. Social media  consists of apps that people can chat or share posts through, such as Snapchat, WhatsApp, Instagram and so on. Social media has both positive and negative effects on people's life. Although the negative effects are more than the positive ones, but still, there are positive effects that help the society. Negative effects have a huge impact on society that restricts and ruins people's lives. Examples of negative effects are, first, spending lots of hours on social media apps checking others' posts and chatting with friends - that affects your vision. Another effect is not spending time with family, the lack of exercise, which makes you obese and in bad health and chat with strangers that might steel you as well as affecting the childs' life by making them spend many hours on videos that lack  good information, which might even make the child a more introverted person than an extroverted one. People are getting affected by bloggers and famous people,  buying the things they buy and eating the food they eat instead of having their own personality, and teenagers are viewing eighteen-plus  and abusive content that might lead to problems in the future. However, even if social media has a negative impact on people, it also has a positive impact on individuals and society. Some of the positive effects are easily finding the information you need by searching through the Internet, learning about new cultures and traditions and easily chatting with friends and FaceTime  calls. In conclusion, social media has been a part of people's life, and it has an effect on people's lives. Social media has both a negative and a positive impact on the society, so people should learn  how to deal with it in a good way.
In this society, many people are on social media. They are either on it to promote a business or to communicate with friends, family and people all around the world. Lately, social media has become toxic to society, and especially to teenagers. Social media isn't the best for anyone's mental health; the amount of hate a person can receive through social media can be very damaging to someone's confidence. It could ruin a person; it could cause someone to fall into depression. Keep in mind that the hate received from social media is from other individuals; all the hatred that is spread is spread by people who carry hatred within themselves. Society would be a better and safe place if people would use these platforms to spread love and peace. Social media can bring out the worst in people; the amount of hours spent on these platforms is damaging to the human brain. Kids are being affected by this at a very young age; having their confidence crushed by people is a lot to handle at that age. If people started using social media for the right reasons, it would have a better effect on individuals and society itself.
Social media is something that affects all people, whether it was in a positive or a negative way. People use social media every day to communicate with people, to meet new people and to search and learn about things they do not know in life. Social media affects individuals in a positive way and in a negative way. The good thing about it is that it allows people to learn new things, to communicate with people in different places and to learn things that will benefit them in their lives. The bad thing about social media is that it does not allow people to socialize and go out. Some people use social media most of their time, and their family does not even see them. This is a bad thing because some people can become antisocial. Social media also affects people in a bad way because a lot of people get bullied on social media, so it sometimes leads people to commit suicide or hate their lives, or they become insecure - they stop communicating with people around them. Social media also affects the society. The society changes according to social media. They start changing culture, the way they think and the way they communicate with others. The society can even get destroyed because of social media because some people may have an opinion about something that happened on social media, and then the others do not agree or have different opinions, so they argue, and people protest against the other people, which can destroy the society, and people will not be on good terms.
The United Arab Emirates went through an instant and rapid development throughout the last decades; these changes attracted international attention from all kinds of people. Whether it could be started by the exploration of oil in the region or the announcement of the tallest building in the world, at some point, this small geographical area started to introduce itself through its achievements. Nevertheless, being in such a melting spot surrounded by this fast process could make it hard for us to realize how it happened and its effects. The most recent major improvement was the new direction that the government took, which is new to the region. Yet it is the future which is enhancing technological inventions and evolving them into the everyday transactions. Moreover, all of the resources - starting from the encouragements to the physical materials and education - are widely open for people who are interested in this field, including the young generation. Another changing point is how the economy of the country is shaping; the natural resource will finish one day, and wheeling to another income is shifting slightly, so it won't make that big of a change. However, it could be a boost to start up and get in the high level to start up if invested correctly. For instance, the industrial field is getting wider each day; also, the tourism sector gives a huge impact to the local economy. To sum up, the development is a continuous process that couldn't end, and we have to cope with it and be a part of it as  thanks for our home.
No matter where you are, you'll always see people scrolling through their phones - either checking up the latest trends or """snapchatting""" their moments for other people. Have you ever wondered if such little applications could cause a big impact on people? Social media has been one of the most used things in this generation; even the elders of every family have caught up with it. Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook - these applications may seem useless and complex, but in reality, people have been spending endless hours on them. Little do they know it's destroying their lives. The impact social media has on individuals is that it could cause a loss of connection with others in real life, hostility and mostly bullying, which, unfortunately, increased the rate of suicide among teenagers. Social media gives people a false image of the perfect life; it encourages people to hide behind masks and pretend to be someone they're not. In fact, social media causes the society to follow unethical trends, which could possibly cause violence in the environment. However, there are some benefits that come from social media; it helps people or families reconnect through video calls or messages that help people build stronger bonds. It also helps people learn about new traditions and culture. In conclusion, social media has more negative effects than positive ones, which means people should watch out and start using it less frequently to avoid being an internet addict.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media can affect an individual in a positive way and a negative way. The positive thing about it is that it makes you know what's happening in the world, it allows you to communicate with your family and friends around you and across the world, it helps you interact with people and socialize, and it also helps you with your studies sometimes and helps you have more knowledge; but it also affects you in a negative way because when you become addicted, it drains your mind, it wastes your time, and you become all about it; you just want to check your phone all the time. Social media is one of the most reasons people procrastinate their work  because new things pop up every second on Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram; it makes you crazy, sometimes without you knowing about it. Social media can affect society; information can spread  to millions, just in a few seconds. This thing has an advantage and a disadvantage; its advantage is that emergencies can be helped quickly, and its disadvantage is that information with no validity can spread instantly. Cyberbullying can happen in the society because of social media because people are on their phones most of the time, but also, it  helps people who are in need of help; it gives you access to help people around you and across the world.
 How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has become a big part of so many people's lives. Social media influencers, especially, have become part of so many individuals' lives, but social media has become somewhat  of a disease and has impacted so many individuals' lives, both in a good and bad way. On a global scale, social media has helped many share their day-to-day   lives and share their stories, but many have misused social media, spreading hoaxes and causing what the teenagers call  """drama"";" it has become the route to bullying and harassment; the people have lost control of what they share online; they would never think they cause harm to someone else or lead them to attempt the unthinkable. Another point that should be taken into consideration is the models that post online; many would think they have the most perfect body, and they live the most lavish lives. Society has become based on how people live and what they have; many have forgotten what it means to be happy; they think the lavish things they get make them happy, and the perfect body makes them happy; in reality, this is the most depressing part. Money is what brings them happiness; it also will cause the downfall of society when everyone loses all the money and family because of this  so-called """perfect" "life""" they were seeking  because they saw it on social media. Globally, this has affected society in both a good and a bad way; it all really depends on how the individual uses the social media - are they seeking happiness, destruction, or just  fun?
Social media can affect  individuals and  society a lot; it affects   the way they think and do.  Social media makes people communicate more and made many people closer; and in society, it has many advantages and disadvantages; like rumors can spread very fast;  it affects individuals by causing them stress and addiction to social media to the level that they lose their focus on many other things in life.  It affects them a lot that they could not communicate face to face and be confident.  On social media, people can hack other accounts and take photos and spread them on social media - that ruined many relationships.  The advantages are a lot; for example, it made people around the world get to know each other more in a very easy way. I  know many people who got married through social media.  News spread very fast, whether it was good or bad, which is good; and if you had an emergency, you can contact the person you want in seconds.  Education is really important, and social media has many benefits for learning from many apps that can help  all ages without even paying, which helps many people in projects or researches. 
This generation is so obsessed with social media these days; it has a big role in affecting our society  and individuals; it affected mostly the kids that are below 10 years old. How did it affect them? By following the wrong people, making the wrong people famous, wasting time and laziness. Laziness could lead to obesity, so it would affect a lot of people;  their time is running out, and they won't even realize that the time and every minute   in your life that you can spend with family is precious; you never know what happens tomorrow. Social media has negative and positive effects, like everything  in life; it has a positive part to it as well as a negative part; so the negative part of social media is bullying, catfishing and racism. A lot of things were developed on social media, and  nobody hates it; they really like it; maybe 20% hate it, but it's mostly liked, so the 20% won't affect the 80%. The positive parts of social media are also a lot, like communicating with families and friends - whether they are in the country or out of the country - and shopping online through social media - it made it so easy for us. Nowadays, people are so lazy, so clever people had the idea to target their weakness through shopping online and a lot of things. Once again, time is so precious; waste it with the loved ones; don't waste it on social media.
The United Arab Emirates has been known for being one of the fastest countries to develop when it comes to education, medicine and housing; and from the early seventies, the UAE went through so many changes throughout  the history - from traditional houses to few of the most advanced and modern houses and skyscrapers. The UAE has been ranked the first in the world for having built the tallest skyscraper - """Burj" "Khalifa""" - and has also built one of the biggest shopping malls in the world, known as """The" Dubai "Mall.""" This mall has more than 2500 shops and restaurants! The UAE is also known for having more than five  tourist-attracting cities, such as Fujairah, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and other several cities. The country is also known for being respectful towards everyone, and the locals have learned to be kind and tolerant to everyone from Sheikh Zayed, the founder of the UAE. The UAE has made a lot of advanced developments in the past 10 years. A few examples of them are that they have built robots to work in cafes,  restaurants and also in some courts. The UAE also developed its own SAT and officially released it in space last year. In my opinion, the UAE should keep envisioning the future and always strive for the better; and I have noticed some positive change in the locals, including myself, and I'm looking forward to what the future holds because the UAE has come far through the advanced technologies and future visions of a modernised country.
The important developments in the UAE The first crucial development, in my opinion, is education here in the United Arab Emirates. The reason why I think that is because the majority of students are graduating from school and going to university, whereas, in the past, if students did not like going to school, it would be okay, and their parents would agree for them to stay at home, especially the female students. However, nowadays, parents are aware of that, and they have more knowledge about how it could affect the student's future in a negative way, so the majority of parents do not allow their kids to drop out of school, and instead, they encourage them to finish school and after that continue with university. In addition to that, this drastic development is shown nowadays in particular by females because lots of females now work. Not only that; they work in the most important, crucial and high-level places in the United Arab Emirates; like we have ministers,  pilots and lots of other different works. So I strongly agree that this is a big development in the United Arab Emirates, which is  very positive. 
 What do you think are the most important developments in the UAE at the moment? As we all know, nowadays in the UAE, the studies are more important than before, and it has changed in a really good way; the most important thing is that it has developed strongly. Studying in schools, universities and colleges is different than before; it's not hard, but they focus on it so much more; it is a great change for our beautiful country. There are many ways to study; of course, we didn't forget the books - we still use them, but we also use iPads or Laptops these days; it is difficult sometimes for the kids who start going to school earlier, but our teachers try their best to teach them step by step and give them knowledge about the new topic. I honestly believe that this is a huge and good change because it also will affect the name of our country in a good way; we are so proud of the UAE, and the UAE is also proud of us. There are so many important developments in the UAE at the moment, but in my perspective, I think this thing is really the most important. We are grateful for our leaders and our country all the time, not just at the moment.
The effect of social media on individuals and society As social media has been and will be developing and evolving over the past and the following years, the effect of it still lingers in our community. As an individual, a lot can affect my personal and social life, but, most importantly, social media leads a major factor in the change that we are now witnessing; a simple word can start wars, and a humble apology can bring up history. Viral videos are the easiest way to affect a human being, both positively and negatively. Nowadays, news is spread in a split second, and it is easier for people to access information and claim private content. Let us start with the most common negative use of social media that can really affect a person and could lead to serious dangers, such as cyberbullying; the most affected age range by cyberbullying starts from 12 until their late 20s; a fake or spam account on Instagram is often used to bully youngsters, and their posts  mostly can send negative threats, which leads to a person losing their sanity. I would like to discuss the unfortunate recent case of Israa Ghareb, a young talented makeup artist killed just because  her jealous cousins spread a rumor about her in the family, so her father and brothers decided to take away her freedom of life; the summary of the story is that she took a video of herself and her fiancé, but her jealous cousin went to her father and told him that Israa went out with a guy before her fiancé, and she needs to be punished. The moral of the case is that social media can really affect an individual in the most gruesome ways that a person could ever imagine,  but the society affects a side of that case; people on the streets were asked by several TV talk shows' hosts about their perspective on this case, and all of the sayings were absolutely negative and really show how a society can be really shallow and irrational;  that TV show  conveys the mindset of a country, and their reputation would be scared for life. I would also like to address the recent major effect on our society - but positively; people are starting accounts on social media to spread awareness about the climate change and try to reach out to middle-aged  people and also teenagers, and our society is doing amazing work  keeping up with the recent news and participating, so social media is a  double-sworded sword; it could really affect an individual or a society, both negatively and positively. As I mentioned earlier, a simple word on social media can start a war, and a humble apology can bring up history, but a positive viral trend or video can really affect us, as individuals and society, positively.
The U.A.E. has developed drastically over the last few decades from infrastructure to being the home of globally known businesses. It is still developing even after its huge achievements because we are always aiming to be number one on a global level. Therefore, one of the most important developments in the United Arab Emirates in 2019 is Expo 2020; that is a huge event that has been in the works since 2015, which will help the U.A.E. to become a destination for investors and to help strengthen the relations between the U.A.E. and other countries. In addition, Expo 2020 is challenging the U.A.E.-based  artists and designers to produce products related to the culture of the United Arab Emirates to teach visitors that the U.A.E. is driven by its culture in every aspect of the country. In addition, I think that the design and art scene is developing in the U.A.E., meaning that there are more opportunities for designers and artists and more places that showcase art pieces for art enthusiasts.
Social media effects Social media is all over the world in the 21 century, and it's something most of us rely on. The differences between us are how we use it, and that affects us and the society around us. Individuals can benefit from social media in many ways; for students, they can contact with other classmates with simple clicks on the smartphone or laptop. Also, it's helpful when buying something; you can read the comments about any product on social media pages, such as Instagram; but if you use social media in a bad way, like writing bad comments that will represent your bad image to other people.  Societies also can get a lot of things from social media. Online marketing is the best way to promote your business and make it spread through societies in an easy way, like advertisements that we see on social media, and also fake news and other stuff that is not real are everywhere on the social media, and that is what we have to prevent to keep our society,  culture  and families safe. We should all learn how to use social media in the right way  to get what we need and what can benefit us.
We are living in a modern age, where everything is done through computer machines. As the years went by, technology kept advancing and reaching new peaks. Currently, the smartest machine is in everyone's hands, and that machine is the smartphone;  almost everyone has a smartphone  for the same reasons, and those are taking pictures, calling people and, most commonly, using social media. Social media is a great tool for communication and knowledge, but it is also the devil in disguise; since a majority of our society has multiple accounts on different social media sites, it is a boiling pot of a variety of people who can either spread toxicity or love. There are a lot of """trolls""" on the Internet whose goal is to irritate others by using forms of bullying. Traditionally, bullying is known to be done face to face, but now it is commonly done on the Internet. When someone posts a picture of themselves on Instagram, they become exposed to millions of users, and if one percent of those users decide to leave a malicious comment, it can easily ruin the uploader's confidence and mental health; having said that, we have to acknowledge social media for being a learning resource. Back then, people used to get their news from daily newspapers, but now the news is updated every second on social networks like Twitter. Our society, in general, has become closer than ever, thanks to the easy communication provided by social media.
A lot of people argue whether social media affects individuals and society or not, does it? Yes, it does, but both in negative and positive ways. Social media is  like a free playground, where everyone can say, share and post whatever they like with not many restrictions. Well, this can be useful and beneficial, but sometimes it is harmful and negative for specific groups of people like kids and people who are maybe from different cultures and who have different religions; the content may be offensive, and it affects people because they get influenced by you or try to copy what you're doing, whether it is good or bad.
Social media has been instilled into our society today to such an extent/level  that it's virtually impossible that a person is not on any social media platform. Everyone  is on social media, from young to old and rich to poor. People use social media for many things, such as socializing, finding and sharing information and even shopping. These are just a few ways that social media can improve people's lives. On the other hand, social media can be harmful and can cause stress and other negative outcomes. There are many social media platforms to choose from; some of the popular ones are Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter and Instagram. As the popularity of social media is  huge and reaching all over the world, there are mixed feelings on these networks and how they impact people's day-to-day life.  Social media has a lot of positive sides; it can  have a positive effect on business, politics and socializing. Through these interactions, people can share ideas, get information and also get exposed to many opportunities. Social media also gives people the opportunity to make new friends and also maintain old friends by simply communicating with them. On the negative side of things, it may cause things such as cyberbullying, invading  privacy and fake news. In conclusion, I think social media is a great thing and can really evolve people's life for the better if they use it the right way; people should be careful of hackers and fake news and should also restrict themselves from overusing social media and sharing too much.
Social media is a big element in people's lives, whether they're children, teenagers or adults. When people go out to eat, they instagram it. When they go to an amusement park, they snapchat it. It has almost become a habit to pick up your phone and take a photo of your plate the minute it gets to your table. Whether it's to update our profile or keep up with other people, we always find ourselves refreshing and switching between apps to make sure we're up to date with everyone and everything. However, what some people turn a blind eye to is the enormous negative effect and influence social media has on us. There are different types of social media apps, but they all share one thing in common. People use it to showcase their lives on the Internet. It could be a selfie, a landscape photo or what they had for lunch. On the other hand, it's mostly selfies that take over those feeds. It could seem like an innocent photo a celebrity or social media influencer shared of themselves. What they don't realize is the thoughts they're planting in people's heads, especially teenagers. Social media sets an unrealistic standard of beauty in our society. For instance, when Kylie Jenner got her lips done and shared a selfie, it had so many negative comments from people not supporting her choice. Yet just a few weeks later, our feeds were filled with people that were replicas of Kylie. Somehow, big lips turned into a beauty standard in a matter of a few weeks, all because of a selfie. Social media could also be a place for people to sell products and pay influencers to sponsor them. You can't deny it; if you saw your favorite celebrity or influencer post about a product they claim to """love""," you'd want to get it too. At the end of the day, it could be the reason they have clear skin or a thin body. There were some beauty supplements that went around for a while. Many influencers had this company's back and posted their products, claiming they have used them and have lost weight. That was until the supplements had to be taken off the website and tested again by scientists. Those pills were making people lose weight so rapidly, increasing their chances of serious illnesses and diseases. Yes, it made them lose weight. However, it probably took a few years off  their lives. People don't necessarily buy those pills to be affected by them. By promoting those brands and pills, they give people the idea that being thin is so important. It's so important that you need to take pills to lose weight very fast. This is another example of the unrealistic beauty standards that are being forced on many people (mostly teenagers). They are made to believe that having a thin or skinny body is what makes people beautiful. It could lead to multiple eating disorders. We should be more aware of the effect it has on us. In conclusion, we usually turn a blind eye to the negative effect society has on our mental health and  self-esteem, just to convince ourselves that it's right to do this and support our favorite celebrities. We should also train ourselves not to  be affected by what we see so much. Not everything we see on social media is true. A person's social media account is basically just a highlight of their life, not all of it.
Social media Social media is a platform that joins billions of people together and kills the thousands of miles separating them from each other. In the 21st era, social media has become an important part of our lives. Some even gain their living off of social media. Although it seems like something positive, it can show a huge amount of negativity in our lives. Social media can be used as a lethal weapon or a helping hand. It all depends on the way people choose to use it. If your friend is studying away from home and thousands of miles are separating you from each other, the only place where you will feel reconnected is most probably on social media platforms. You could open Skype, and suddenly, all the distance is minimized, and your friend is only one click away. You could see each other using the camera and hear each other, and it would be like you've never been apart. Social media can also be used as a tool to spread awareness about any issue concerning the well-being of our world. Recently, social media platforms have been filled with news about the fire in the Amazon forests. Using this simple tool, the whole world became engaged in a huge issue affecting our environment. We all put our hands together and did whatever we can to save our Earth. Some people filmed themselves while picking trash from the sea. Others started using steel straws for drinking instead of using plastic straws and throwing them after. These are all positive ways to use social media. On the contrary, social media can be used as a lethal weapon. It can be used to break up relationships between families or friends. In an early morning, a family gathers for breakfast at one table, but there is not one laugh heard. This is because the parents are busy with their phones, and the kids are scrolling down Instagram or chatting with their friends. Social media can also be used to hurt others or spread rumors about someone and ruin their image. Usually, teenagers are responsible for these kinds of acts through what we call  """Cyberbullying""." Some kids expose their friends' secrets on social media platforms or start spreading rumors about them. At this stage of their lives, teenagers are affected by these things greatly. This act or behavior makes the person that is being bullied feel weak and helpless. This also affects how they do in class and may bring down their grades. Some kids even attempt suicide because they do not feel welcome in this world anymore. Social media has two completely different sides. It all depends on the way we choose to use it. We need to be careful while using social media platforms and try to spread positive energy while using them.
Social media is different platforms you can access using the Internet, where individuals can communicate with one another, share their ideas and express their opinion. In our modern day, social media has  stormed our life and become one of the main sources of communication between individuals; but how does it affect us as individuals? Social media affects individuals in both negative and positive ways. Social media has made it easier for people to communicate with one another, regardless of the distance between them. It made individuals more aware of what is happening around the world by hearing from the people who are there rather than hearing the news on the news. Social media can also be a safe space for people who feel like they are different or  outcasts; they can find people whom they can identify with and can understand what they are going through. People won't feel alone. While there are a lot of positive things about social media, there is a negative part of it. People become so consumed with social media that they forget to live in the moment, and they started to befriend people online and communicate with them that they forgot to communicate with the people around them; that's why a lot of people - especially teenagers - haven't developed the basic skills of communication with people because they rely on social media a lot. Another disadvantage of social media is that people become obsessed with appearances because of the social media influencers who set false standards for teenagers. More people became insecure about their appearance and shallow rather than being concerned with their personalities and the important things in life.
For the past 48 years, the United Arab Emirates has developed a lot. Dubai was basically a desert; it had no structures, buildings, hospitals and main roads, but over time, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan stepped into the community and changed this desert into a stunning city; this has made a big step in the UAE. Sheikh Zayed Al Nahyan always cared about gardening; he always used to ask the workers to plant palm trees and other plants, just to make sure his country has a soul and is beautiful. Roads began to be structured, buildings started to be built and the whole UAE has developed and progressed into a better country. At the moment, the UAE has developed a lot; everything is available, like jobs and more, and now that Expo 2020 is next year; it is a really big accomplishment that will be happening in the UAE, and it will be held in Dubai; portraits of strength and courage will be assigned there, and people from all around the world are going to be there. The country had put a lot of effort into this big exhibition, and I am pretty sure it will be a big one.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has had a huge impact on the world and not just the society we live in; everyone here has been affected by it. Over the past few years, social media has changed significantly; it has been developed and put into good use. People have been using it to communicate with their families, friends and humans, in general, from all over the world, and they made it seem so efficient and easy. There are always advantages and disadvantages to everything, but social media is definitely something you should be careful of since everything can go wrong in seconds. You can publish a video of yourself or someone, and it could go viral in minutes, and there's no going back from it. You may get some hate or love; it just depends on how you handle it. People have been affected by social media way too much that they committed suicide. You can get hate and love, but you shouldn't let that get to you; you are way too important to end your life just because of someone who said some bad things to you, and you are much stronger than them. Social media has become  essential to people, and it made their life so much easier, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to see that change. You should focus more on the good and what makes you happy.
Social media sites offer the chance to share as well as create content. Through this content, people could spread knowledge, experiences and just about anything. In our decade, social media is a huge iconic phenomenon. Social media is advertised around the nation in countless ways. Social media affects our nation in many positive ways as it is proven to assist in educating people. Through those social networking sites, people are exposed to an abundant sum of information. One could simply learn about any matter through a quick click on their computer. It is the new normal in our society for every person to possess an account on those social media sites. Social media has powerful platforms and is respected by the nations. Some people get their everyday news reports from social network sites, such as Twitter and Reddit. Social media is also used to spread awareness about issues in society. It also gives individuals a platform to share their thoughts and beliefs. Social media can also have a negative effect on its users. Addiction is a serious effect caused by those social sites. Many people develop an obsession with constantly updating their sites. Over time, social media can take a negative toll on our economy and society. Many people can start working independently online and in turn cause a social decline in our society. Social media can also take a negative toll on our health. Excessive use of social networking sites can decline exercise time. Eye problems could develop after repetitively spending long hours online. Although social media has its negative aspects, the positives definitely outweigh them. Social media can be extremely beneficial if used modestly and properly.
Social media and the world Have you ever wondered about what  the effects of social media are? Everything in this world is  two-faced; social media is considered one of the most powerful weapons that may be used in a good way or another. In this essay, I am going to discuss the effects of social media on individuals and society if used in a good way. Social media is considered one of the best developments that have ever happened in this universe. Society is much closer than ever before; the whole world is like a small village, thanks to social media. You don't have to seek  news about the outer world; news comes to you with just one click on your electronic device. Society has been very connected because of social media; also, individuals are the main part of any society, so whenever individuals are connected, society will be even more bound by a strong relation. Furthermore, social media is so helpful for individuals who live far away from home and have relatives who don't live nearby, and there are so many situations where social media may be more than useful. In the past, people spent weeks and months waiting for a response to a message from someone just a couple of kilometers away. However, nowadays, a message is  sent and received in less than a second from people miles away. As I mentioned, social media is a blessed invention. It kept people connected with each other and eyes opened about what is happening in the world. Use it wisely and the society will always remain bound by a strong relation.
Social media can affect individuals and society in many ways. Individuals   nowadays depend on social media in many ways to the point where they believe everything on social media, which affects their life; in other words, social media has a negative impact on individuals, such as teenagers. Teenagers use social media as a place to bully other individuals; in my opinion, that's a major effect of social media. How can social media affect the society? The society can use social media to raise awareness for problems that the society has, which can also be held by teenagers because they tend to be on social media most of the time doing nothing; at least, they can  meet; people tend to meet on social media and not trying out  to help the society in some way. Social media can be a great thing for the society only if it was used in the right way. Nevertheless, social media can be a great platform  for advertising; individuals in the society can promote their work on such a great platform  that can reach all over the world. In conclusion, social media does affect individuals and  society in positive and negative ways; either way, people should try and use social media in the right way and not drift to the bad ways.
How do you communicate with your family and friends? By sending a handwritten letter and waiting 3 days for the reply? May I also ask you how  you get to know the daily news? Is it by reading the newspapers with a cup of coffee every morning? Well, both of us know the answers to these questions, and it's through social media. Social media has developed an enormous number of users, but it has its positive and negative effects on individuals and society as well. The social media has become used by individuals all around the world, which, I can say,  has made life much easier. Do you remember the first question I asked about how  you communicate with other people? Social media has made it easier to keep in touch, where you can say """Hi""" just by clicking the send button on your phone, and he/she can reply the same way or by starting a video call! That's amazing, right? Moreover, you are able to read the news online and know people's opinions about it. Also, if you're too lazy to check the news every day, you can just subscribe to any newspaper you like and get notifications about what's happening now. The intensive use of social media nowadays doesn't mean that it doesn't have a negative side. One of these effects can be social isolation, where you no longer communicate with people face to face but instead, prefer to chat online. This may cause several mental illnesses, such as anxiety and depression. People of the society will no longer have a strong connection as before; for example, family members will be isolated, each in his/her room. They may only see each other once  a day at the dinner table, and this really affects the bond between them. Social media has a huge impact on our lives and affected them in both a positive and a negative way. Personally, I think the negative effects are more than the positive ones.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has various effects on individuals and society that are both positive and negative. Although the word """social""" is in the title, interactions between people have been occurring digitally, meaning  that face-to-face interactions are lost. People have become drawn to their phones as if they are addicted to them, thus making them antisocial. Social media is a good place to allow  self-expression; for example, Instagram is a platform that allows users the freedom to post pictures of their lives,  edit them using their desired filters and edit them in their own way. Over time, people have grown creatively as they take inspiration from other Instagrammers and use it themselves. Social media has also provided job opportunities by sponsoring social influencers to promote products to their followers. However, this comes with the negative backlash from some people, which creates pressure for the influencer as they feel like an expectation has been set that they did not reach. This also translates to society, where social media creates standards for women, for example. On social platforms, women are presented as skinny, tall and beautiful. Society then takes these conventions of women and pressures girls about what is expected from them, and when they can't meet those expectations, they are overwhelmed by feelings of insecurity and sadness, which leads to mental illnesses and eating disorders. On the other hand, these typical beauty conventions that social media displays have also led to the formation of a new society that rebels against these expectations and teaches women that it is okay not to follow the rules of beauty because everyone is beautiful in their own way.
Do you know that about 85% of the individuals are using social media every day? This is really a huge number! However, social media nowadays makes a huge effect on the society. There are positive and negative effects of using social media. Moreover, it leaves a huge impact on the individuals. There are a lot of advantages to using social media. One of the most benefits of using social media  is that you get more experiences and knowledge if you are using it correctly. In addition, most people probably use the social media as a resource of money, where they create their own business. Nowadays, there are plenty of different accounts on  Instagram and Snapchat, where they sell their own items. Furthermore, some people use social media as  entertainment; they spend a lot of time chatting with friends on Instagram, Telegram and Twitter.  In addition, there are a lot of accounts on Instagram that suggest solutions for problems and listen to the people as they give them solutions. On the other hand, social media affects negatively  the society  when it uses it wrongly, such as dealing with destroying the security of the country. Moreover, some people communicate together to destroy a bank or any huge companies. In the nutshell, we can't say that social media affects the society and individuals negatively, but it depends on how the people use it, either in a negative or positive way.
In this generation, social media has a huge impact on individuals and society, in general. Social media is where people communicate with each other and share their thoughts and what they are  going through with everyone around the world with different cultures and traditions.  Everything we do in life has its positives and negatives, where social media has its positives and negatives as well; the individual has his own choice to choose whether to use it in a good way that makes the individual a better person or a useless person while using social media. The positive effects social media has on individuals and society is that you become a social person and interact with different individuals from different parts of the world, and you learn from their culture and become an  open-minded person; another positive effect is that social media can help improve your knowledge, where you can use websites, like Google Chrome, the Internet and more to get important information that can help you in your studies, researches and projects, which every individual needs in this society. The negative effects social media has on individuals and society is that it can take your time to finish up your goals and work and can make you a lazy person with no goals and achievements. As well as that, the social media world  has a lot of bullying and racism, where social media has  cyberbullying and  cyberhacking, which are the most popular kind of bullying in this generation, which can lead to people being less self-confident, which is a serious problem any person could have. In my opinion, the individual has his own choice whether they use it in a good way or a bad way that can lead you to not be able to trust yourself and people around you.
  Nowadays, almost everyone  uses social media; we use social media for many things, like talking to others and meeting new people;  we even use social media to know the news of the world and of other countries. Social media has changed in these few years; many things have been upgraded to be better and some to be worse.  Social media affected many people's lives; it made their lives easier, and it helped them a lot, but there is a dark side of social media. Social media affected many people's lives; adults may use the media in a good and in a useful way, but other generations might not use it in  a useful way, like kids and teens; they might be tricked by others;  they can even be kidnapped through social media by older people, but we can use social media in many useful ways too.  We use social media  most of our time to communicate with others and our families;  we learn new things and learn about other countries from social media.  Social media affects every person individually;  it could make someone's life better, but other people might be miserable because of social media (because of other people's comments), and the bad news that they see on social media would affect their lives.  In the society, social media made others' lives better cause it made people's lives easier, and it's easier to communicate with our beloved ones.  In a way, social media can be helpful and makes our lives better, but it can be also not very helpful. Social media has changed the world into a better place and made our lives so much easier, but we have to make sure that we use social media in the right way and in a useful way and make sure to teach the others to use social media in the right way.
Social media has a very big effect on the society; it can be unrealistic information or information that is not accurate that it changes people's minds in many different ways. Many people do not approve of using social media as it has a very negative side, and   it may as well contain much toxic and unrealistic information. Therefore, social media can have a great impact on people as you may learn many different things and develop your mindset; it should be restricted for young people as it may include bad content. As we all know, social media nowadays is very popular in many types of categories; for example, if you want to learn about any specific thing, it will appear easily. The society may change, unfortunately, as many individuals come up with rumors or bad decisions that many other people learn from social media. I think that people under the age of 15 shouldn't be using social media because they may attach a very bad habit to themselves as this generation doesn't have a good image. A lot of children use social media now. I think that the society should make social media a secure and safe place for people to go online and should be restricted for younger people, or their parents should be watching cause you can't trust a child on social media. Finally, many people agree that there should be a lot of changes made to make it a safe and secure place.
Social media and how it affects individuals and society Social media is a platform that almost every individual uses; whether you're a teenager or an adult, we all use it. Twitter, Skype, Snapchat and Instagram are some examples of social media, but what effect does it have on us individuals? What makes us """addicted""" to our phones to the point where we have to check them so often? People are always looking for ways to communicate with each other; nowadays, barely anyone has the time to meet up with friends or family, and they use an alternative, such as Skype: a  video-calling chat which allows us, individuals, to communicate with others via tablet or smartphone. I believe that people don't see the importance of  """get-togethers""" or gatherings, which is the main thing that helps us bond with each other. Every day, a new social media app becomes popular, and every day, we draw ourselves away from the idea that it will make us check our phones more often, and it could lead to a lot of negative outcomes in our daily life.
Social media has a huge impact on societies in both a positive and a negative way. First, the positive effects. Social media can be a great way of communication and allows you to contact and stay in touch with  long-distance friendships; you can also be updated with the news and new trends; not only news, but also, it's a way of learning and getting knowledge as well as following people you love, such as authors, influencers and more. Somehow, social media can be useful for entrepreneurs and businesses because you can have advertisements for free. On the other hand, social media can have a negative influence on people and societies by spreading rumors and fake news. Social media can take you away from your family and friends because we no longer have face-to-face   chats and gatherings; instead, we just send a text message or  call to ask about our beloved ones. It can also take you away from your hobbies and interests because nowadays, people spend their free time scrolling down  timelines and watching posts and videos all over social media applications instead of reading a book, painting or any other hobby. After all, we can choose how we can be affected by social media. If we used it in a good way, it will have a good and positive influence, and if we misused it, it will affect us in a negative way.
Today, social media is one of the most interesting ways to communicate with others, and it saves a long time and distance to send a message,  a photo or even a voice message, but it has effects, and it can come positively or negatively; it depends on  your ways of using it; in the positive ways, as we said before, it saves your time instead of sending letters and waiting for  months to get the response and waiting more extra months to receive the letter from the sender; you can even start your business from your house in your room starting from zero, and it doesn't mean that the social media is 100% safe and good; it can affect you negatively and ruin your life. The normal average to use it is 2 hours in a day, but some people, especially teenagers, use their phone up to 6-8 hours in a day, and this is absolutely a bad usage; parents should keep their eyes on their children, and they have to know what their kids are doing and whom they are texting because they could have psychosocial issues, and it could affect their feelings, and they could lose their children for that. Finally, you have to know how to use social media in a good way to provide getting in troubles.
Nowadays, everyone has a fingerprint  on the Internet through social media. Social media can change lives, personalities and mentalities; it can be a good or a bad thing, depending on how  you use it. Social media is an important resource to be open to the world, to know more than others and to communicate with them; it makes lives easier and can help to develop the countries, to know new cultures from other countries and to share knowledges, but if you used the social media in a bad way, it can affect you and your community in the same way. If every person takes their responsibility to use the Internet and social media in a good way, they will decrease the cyberbullying, sharing unethical things and ejaculation; they will get a good idea about the community and the culture. The social media life has  many impacts on the person's mentality; it can make you feel down or happy and feel less about yourself cause everything on social media is perfect. Although social media can be a waste of time, it can make you waste all of your time by doing nothing - only watching celebrities or some TV shows. Countries and  self-development are built on the Internet and social media, so everyone should take their responsibility and use it carefully.
Social media is really important nowadays, and everyone is using it.  Social media will help the society in different ways, positive and also negative. Social media can be positive and helpful because you can stay in touch with family and friends, and you can find and interact with new people who may have the same interests as you; finding news is easier with social media, and the best thing is social media is a free platform. Positive social media will help the society to stay together and be strong without any issues, but the disadvantages or the negative side of social media is popular nowadays. My first example is bullying; it is now a huge issue in our society because people have access to others people's lives; social media can be used by terrorists on the highly extreme side, and it can also distract you from your studies; social media can give you a fake life that you appear by  in front of your followers. I can see that nowadays the negative side of social media is bigger, and it is affecting the society. In my opinion, social media can be helpful, and you can have fun using it if you interact with it in a positive way.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has become one of the most dependent resources in life. The effect of social media on society has increased in the last couple of years. What is social media? Social media consists of applications that help you connect with others, share pictures with them and even more. Social media has become a huge part of our lives, and some people can't go one day without using it. Social media has affected society in good ways and bad ways. Many adults, teenagers and kids have become addicted to life on social media to the point where they can't go hours without using their phones. Some people have also become emotionless while using social media; for example, if someone doesn't like the other, they immediately block them. The worst effect social media has on society is that it distracts people from what's happening around them in the present time. Generations are becoming more dependent on technology and social media that they forget to live their own life. Although social media has great negative effects on society, it also has many positive advantages; for example, communication has become easier in so many ways with applications, like WhatsApp, Twitter and Skype. Another advantage is that social media has become a big part of the business industry because a lot of businesses use Instagram or Snapchat to promote their new products or services, and this costs you less than promoting your business on a billboard or on TV. In conclusion, social media has affected society in so many different ways. I trust that social media has its advantages, but also is a great distraction from the real world, and I believe people should control the time they spend on it.
Social media can affect individuals and  society in different ways. Addiction is a huge problem for many teenagers and young adults as they spend most of their time using different applications to engage and communicate with friends, or even new people, all around the world. Applications that many of us use on a daily basis, like Snapchat, Instagram and Twitter, are a very easy and effective way to quickly communicate with others; however, every individual's time should be managed, and you can easily do that from the settings of any iPhone by controlling how many hours you'd want to spend on social media. That makes a positive impact on our society as well as individuals as they wouldn't be as attached to their devices and would make some time for other activities and hobbies in their daily routines. By doing this, there is a bigger chance that young adults would focus more on their studies and work, making them achieve a successful future for themselves. In contrast, there are many positive points for social media as it can be used for studying and teaching purposes or even as a place for advertising many small businesses of various Emiratis who would like to expand their businesses. Social media can benefit us only if we use it properly and manage our time on it so that it does not distract us from building a great future for ourselves.
Social media has a big impact on people, especially this generation and all the new inventions.  People depend on social media to share content with their beloved ones to know where they are  or what they ate, such as through photos, videos and more; so as society, people now prefer to sit on their phone for a long time instead of having a chat with the people surrounding them; this caused you to be  apart from people who care about you, such as your family. Not all parents understand what social media is and the way  it works; they feel like it is a thing that separated them from their kids. Some use social media as if it's their job, so they earn money for every post they post as  advertising material. We can look at the biggest example, which is Kim Kardashian; she might get paid more than 10,000 per post by the companies. The shocking part is people do buy the stuff she advertises claiming that they can get the body she has or the hair even though it's all a scam, and she does have a big following; the last time I checked, there were over 100 million followers; but let us not forget that the good thing social media brought to us is removing distance; there are a lot of free apps that help us connect,  like Skype; so from this, we can understand that everything  has  two sides to it - either a good or a bad thing.
Nowadays, people use technology in every part of their lives. We use social media to connect with people all over the world and read the latest news and updates that happen  every second. It affects our lives a lot, and that can be positively or negatively. Social media helps people connect and communicate easily now, so you can talk to your family and friends wherever you are and whenever you want. On the other hand,  It can harm your physical and mental health;  using your phones and laptops for a long period of time can harm your eyes,  your joints,  and your mental health, in general. Social media plays an important role in education and health. You can find the best universities and colleges online (and directly register without wasting your time), the latest health and wellness products and hospitals and clinics all over the world. One of the worst disadvantages of social media for the community is that it can make people lazy and careless;  sometimes, people would not work hard to get what they want because social media applications make them too busy to work and get things done. To conclude,  everything around us has advantages and disadvantages, so we always need to use our time wisely and put limits for everything  in life. In my opinion, social media has a positive effect on both individuals and societies more than a negative effect as long as we use it in a useful and right way.
Social media is a different kind of apps that you can download  on your phones or any tablet.  In my opinion, social media has a huge impact on both individuals and society. Of course, like any other thing, there is a positive side and a negative side of social media.  Social media has great benefits for  both individuals and society. It helps individuals in many ways if they use it correctly. It introduced  them to new information, and it helped them think outside the box and be more social with the people around them;  it also helped them meet new people. Social media helped the society by spreading good behavior around and by spreading kindness and awareness of what is happening in our world today. Even though there is lots of positive impact from the social media, there is still a negative side.  The negative side for the individuals is that bullying can happen easily  and the lack of  self-confidence;  and for the society, it spreads more hatred;  and the biggest negative side is that people spend lots of time on social media, which lets them forget about the world around them;  especially for parents and kids, social media can really affect them in a negative way if they didn't use it correctly; so in my opinion, you're the one that can control the effect that social media would have on you. 
How does social media affect individuals and society? Teenagers and millennials nowadays are addicted to their phones, and I think that it affects their social life. It affects them in the sense that some people get bullied, and it affects them negatively; and it leads to social anxiety because they see everyone  on social media living """perfect" "lives""," although it's all edited and selected; so people get jealous and start envying people, so they try to blame other people for it even though it's no one's fault. Social media affects the society because it makes people addicted to their phones,  it doesn't let people socialize, and it turns us into antisocial creatures that don't know how to communicate with others, and it is a negative effect; but it can also benefit the society. It can help raise awareness about our society. For example, it helped raise awareness about the Amazon forest being caught on fire and forced people to talk about it. Some people helped set up fundraisers. Also, because of social media, people are more aware of pollution, and now teenagers are trying to prevent pollution by using less plastic and making less waste. To conclude, social media has both negative and positive effects on our society.
In my opinion, I think social media has been the most important thing for everyone. Everyone uses it in the whole part of the earth. It also has a lot of benefits in it, for example, knowing about the news and how everything is going on, and it's also easier for everyone because people had to get out to buy some newspapers, and it takes a lot of time, and probably half of the people were lazy. What is also good about it is that you also can know news  from the other countries; yes, it also can be in the  newspaper, but maybe they take few days to write it down, and on your phone or laptop, you can know it in just one second. One of the best benefits of the social media is that you can call people from different countries, and that's really good and helpful. The best part of that is you can do [INCOMPLETE]
Social media affects individuals and society in many different ways. It affects individuals by either making them interested in a good way or a bad way. In the bad way, it may distract you from what you need to do or make you do something; for example, these days, a person can get influenced by an influencer; that will cause problems because maybe they can't afford something, or they are benefiting from them, and it will even cause problems in the society; it's just because they influence people's lives and make them do things, and others can benefit them. In the good way, they can learn things they never thought about finding, and they can share experiences that are either  coming from an individual or a group of people; at the end, they both impact  each other. Nowadays, everyone - whether you're too young for social media or too old - is  affected by it. How does it affect? It affects  by letting the media control your life,  making a decision that's not suitable for you, benefiting from it and mostly causing problems, either mentally or physically. People are just showing off these days and making other people jealous, and they are negative in life; social media these days is just showing off what you have and getting money - that's my opinion.
Social media has a huge effect on the society in my opinion. Nowadays, people use social media mostly every single day; it's  a routine in their day. Social media is more of a positive effect than a negative one; people get to talk to their loved ones that are far from them and get to know new people, and news gets to spread faster and easier; but mostly, society sees social media as a big negative effect on kids and teenagers. Kids get affected easily by what they see on the Internet; it's mostly because their parents don't teach them what's good for them and what's not and what kind of strangers to beware of.  What's good on the Internet is that parents could use parental control on their child's phone to see what they're doing. Nowadays, we have influencers on our social media; social media is kinda their job; what they do is that they promote stuff so people get to buy it, and they make money out of it. Some influencers have a negative effect on individuals; they build insecurities in their viewers, who are half of the society; they lose their self-love   and much more. In my opinion, some people see that as a negative effect, and some don't, but I see it as a positive effect on the world.
Social media has been an important part of our life nowadays; it has its negative and positive effects on individuals, depending on how we all use it. However, it also affects the society and how people are communicating with each other, and that changes how we communicated before and in our recent days. Social media plays a big role in some people's life, especially in this generation, where a lot of people depend on technologies. Communicating with our friends became easier, thanks to social media; most of us agree that it is easier to share your interests on the Internet, and people who have similar interests will interact with you since it is easier to find someone who shares the same interests on social media than in real life. Furthermore, I also think that people with social anxiety or any social problems have more chances to get to know people through social media as a first step to being interactive because, for them, it is hard to communicate with other beings face to face. As I mentioned above, social media can affect individuals in a negative way too, depending on how you use it. One of the most common negative impacts of social media is """Cyberbullying""." Some people get quite comfortable with their friends on social media that they post anything on it; however, not everyone reacts positively to the things that people post; some will criticise in a bad way that will put the other person in a bad situation that could lead the individual   to think of committing suicide, and that affects our society in many ways. In summary, social media has helped our life in a way by making communicating with our friends and family easier, but it does have its bad ways of affecting people in our society; we have ways to prevent it, and society is trying its best to avoid making it more horrible.
As long as there is a new generation always coming up with something new, the influence must be from social media. There's something always positive and negative about social media since it affected a lot of people in a good and bad way. We have people of all ages who use social media, whether to socialize and communicate, to be other people's idols or to help support other influencers. However, the majority of the society doesn't use social media and thinks that it always has a bad influence on the younger generation. Having so many people against using social media makes the society argue about whether it has a good influence on their kids; and some think that  their kids are able to talk and communicate with people from all around the world, and the idea of that makes them scared, and maybe, they'll even try convincing people to stop using social media; for example, there are people who use social media to bully others and might even drive them to suicide, which can cause big issues in the society. On the other hand, there are so many positive things about social media, such as people being able to sell homemade products from scratch with such cheap prices and maybe even free delivery and good offers. There are people using social media to learn new languages and help others learn.
In this century, the social media has a big impact on us as  individuals and societies and changed the human beings a lot from what they were before. The social media has some advantages and disadvantages.  First of all,  the social media makes people communicate all around the world and makes the world a smaller place by keeping all the societies close to each other and making it easy to communicate with each other; some examples of the social media applications are Instagram,  Snapchat and YouTube. Of course, everything  has advantages and disadvantages, so let's discuss social media advantages and disadvantages.  The first advantage of the social media is that it helps you make new friends, and it helps you keep in touch with your friends,  colleagues and people you want to talk to.  Another advantage is that it makes you open to the world and know what is happening around the world, just by opening your phone.  The social media also has disadvantages.  Firstly, social media keeps a gap between family members, and that is something that should not happen between family members;  and most criminals use social media as a way to reach or trap their prey.  In conclusion,  the social media is a good way to contact the world, but also we should be aware of its consequences. 
Social media is very important in our generation because now everything works on smart devices, and some people contact others using  social media, like Snapchat, but sometimes, social media affects society because of how people use social media, like spreading rumors or using it to make others fall into a bad situation. Social media helped a lot of people with much stuff; like it helps people who work in a small business    to spread their work; some started to work on social media, like models, or help people who have got a huge business to spread  around the world, but by paying them, and this got bigger now; some people use social media and affect kids by their way of speaking or personalities; that's why everyone should use social media in a way that doesn't make kids get a bad personality and behavior. Some people think that social media is bad to use because of some of its bad effects and how it makes their children ignore their homework - because of what people spread - and makes them think about things that do not help them with their schoolwork  or their life. Social media made some people happy because of how it helped them with the work or business they do, and some were not because it affected their life in a negative way, so people should use it in a good way to make them think in a positive way.
Social media affects individuals and societies greatly, whether that is in a negative or a positive way. This is due to the  prevalence and significance of social media in our daily lives. Most people would say that social media is almost replacing major newspaper companies, which is evidenced by companies' shift into the digital age with known newspapers, such as The Telegraph, becoming available on popular social media, such as Snapchat. In this way, social media has a vast effect on people of all demographics, especially young adults. As well as spreading global news, social media is effective in joining communities together and creating subcultures;  it can be used to communicate with family members and friends as well as strangers with similar interests and lifestyles. Moreover, social media has made an abundance of possibilities more realistic and tangible as it can also be used in an educational way. Platforms such as YouTube have many educational resources that have personally helped me throughout high school with subjects ranging from history to chemistry. There were also instances where teachers would use these videos in class to help explain a concept in an easy and simplified way. For this reason, it is hard to deny that social media has a great impact on us as a society.
Social media is a worldwide element that mostly everyone has access to.   Social media can be a source of distraction for an individual and society but could also be a point of improvement and inspiration. It all comes down to the way one chooses to use it and how much you let the content affect you. If used improperly, people's lives could be affected. The expectations that society has put up for individuals - ranging from the status to what you should look like - have brought  robot-like living to our world. With those expectations being brought up, some individuals have made it their life goal to reach them, leaving their skills and their talents on hold. With that, what one could've invented and improved is lost, and society moves hopelessly towards the future. Those expectations have also raised the percentage of depression as the fact that each person is unique in their own way and that there is no uniform to what makes a person great and exceptional has not been accepted.
Social media plays an important role in our society. Social media has changed our lives in many different ways. Most people use social media as a way of communicating with others. It affects not only individuals, but   the society itself. Nowadays, technology has enhanced the way of communication.  People don't tend to talk face to face anymore. In addition, individuals started using social media as a way of showing their happiness or sadness. Social media can affect the person, both physically and mentally. For instance, social media can be a way to track sports news and may lead the person to be physically healthy. However, social media can also affect a person mentally. It can lead to depression,  anxiety or even suicidal thoughts. The society itself can be destructed by social media. It can spread hatred among people in the society. Social media does affect the way a society would work and represent itself to other communities. It can either bring them closer toward a strong community or pull them down toward a weak community. Most importantly, social media has had an effective way of upgrading the community and an individual's mentality towards many objects. The world wouldn't be what it is without social media.
a) Tolerance is one of the most important things that are needed for a society to function properly. Without tolerance, we wouldn't be where we are today, the melting pot of cultures that come together and coexist as one. The United Arab Emirates is a country that is known for its tolerance and acceptance; to further emphasize this, the year 2019 has been named the year of tolerance by the ruler of the UAE. What an ideal way to promote tolerance in the country when the world around us is falling to its feet, when racism has become the new fashion and when the number of hate crimes has risen in the most developed countries in the world! We, as a country, cannot stress enough the importance of tolerance in our daily lives; we even have a minister of tolerance that goes to lengths to satisfy the needs of the many religions and nationalities in our country as they too are a crucial pillar in society. The UAE is already doing a great job in promoting tolerance in the country as it is instilled in us, taught in our schools and shown to us on a daily basis. I am very fortunate to live in a country that goes to lengths to ensure the happiness of its residents regardless of age, gender, religion or ethnicity.
In the 21st century, social media is a major influence on people's minds. All our lives revolve around how famous or how active we are on these tools, and we have no choice but to be  followers of these brainwashers. Social media has many benefits and withdrawals, but it all depends on how the person uses it. One important benefit includes how easy it is to reach out to everyone. Technology has made our lives easier, and we are able to travel the world while lying down on our comfy beds. Important and useful messages can be heard by everyone, and through that, we can help spread peace and have a huge influence on people's opinions. On the other hand, as well as useful messages, famous influencers on social media could misuse this advantage and use it for their own benefit. They could spread inappropriate material that could create a bad influence on the young uneducated generations. In my opinion, social media has created a huge impact on individuals and  society because people are so easily affected by influencers and their unhealthy  lifestyles, leading to them being taken as role models. The damage is already created, and all the parents could do right now is educate their children in the right way to use these social media.
Social media has a major effect on our lives. There are a variety of sources we could communicate with family and friends through, for example, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook. Having those kinds of social media can help develop the society, but it can harm our society as well. Social media has its advantages and disadvantages, and I will start with the disadvantages. Social media has to be used in the right way, or else it will harm our society. A disadvantage is bullying or blackmailing. There is numerous amount of people each year committing suicide because of bullying. People threaten them or spread rumors about them, which can lead to suicide because they lose their confidence in themselves. In my opinion, social media has to have some sort of protection, just to help stop people from committing suicide and help them solve their issues online. Now, I will start talking about the advantages of social media. Social media opens a wide place for businesses, such as marketing and transportation. It helps people to sell their items online through Google and transport them in and outside the country through Aramex or DHL, which are the most common apps used to transport products. Another advantage is communication; you can communicate with your friends and family through WhatsApp, and you can send pictures and videos so that they can check how you are doing in life, so you just have fun together. By using social media, you can easily find friends you can relate to and text them so that you can seek some advice from them.
Social media plays a big role in our daily lives today. People spend most of their time on social media to the point where it has decreased the time people use to communicate with people in real life. This impacts both individuals and  society. Although social media has many disadvantages, it has some advantages, and one of them is that it combines all types of media into one platform. People are now more aware of what goes on around the world; this is because they can easily check the news on these applications, without having to wait for it to be shown in newspapers and on television. Some people also use it to create and start their business, which often leads to using it as a form of advertising. Another advantage is that communicating with people around the world has become more accessible and easy. They can socialize with friends and family, without having to meet them in person, and that has disadvantages. People now talk to each other more using social media applications rather than in person; this affects their speaking and communication skills; this also has an effect on their language, which affects us as a society.
The Internet has brought us  developments, enhancing the ways of communication. Social media, including Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat, has spread its popularity worldwide. Not a single day passes without people  browsing their social media pages. Nowadays, everyone knows what the other is doing even when they are miles apart, with just a single click. People have become more shallow over the years as the use of social media increased drastically. Individuals seem to care more about their appearances so the pictures they would take and upload on social media for others to see would be well received. Their lives are no longer  spontaneous and humble. There are times when they would rehearse a scene a couple of times, just for it to be perfect for others to watch on their social media page in awe. Owning the fanciest cars or bags has become a priority for many individuals. Those that follow such standards are the most followed on social media pages and are received with likes on their posts. Society has developed social pressure on individuals to always look a certain way and dress or act in  certain manners. It is like they are caged in a world where they live for others. Everyone uses social media extensively, and most of them don't get much use out of it. At all times, whether they are at work, university, home or right before they sleep, people check their phones and open social media. As a society, it would be more beneficial for individuals if they would back off social media a bit and not make it the center of their attention.
 Social media plays a massive role in shaping individuals in our society. Back in the day, social media was either  nonexistent or not very common; people were very social and engaged in everyday activities and kept each other's company. However, now people all around the world of all ages participate in social media. This can be both good and bad. For example, social media allows people to access information faster than ever before and allows a global connection for businesses. Social media has a downside as it makes people less social; it can be addictive. People will decide to stay in their rooms to surf the web and go on many varieties of apps instead of going out and meeting new people. This negatively affects our society. Social media is a very good concept if you use it wisely; if you do, it will make an individual smarter, and they can create friendships around the world. However, if it is used in a bad way, or if it does get to a point where it is getting addictive, it will have a bad impact on the individual as it  pulls them away from the reality of life and detaches them from society.
Social media is a very important thing in our lives. However, 100 years ago, people didn't really use it. They used to communicate with each other physically.  Society changed after the technology developed in good and bad ways. Although this change has changed how  lifestyle used to be,  it's still better than not changing at all, right? It's right that we don't communicate face to face that much, but it's not always a negative thing. In my opinion, I think that sometimes, it's better to talk to people by phone than talking to them personally. We have to admit that sometimes, we don't laugh out loud when our friend tells a joke, but still, we can pretend that we do, and  that's so they don't be sad. Social media doesn't only affect communication; it even affects our physical life too. I think it's such a bad thing that people stay all night watching Netflix instead of sleeping and texting their friends or even posting on Instagram instead of working out. Not only did it affect the society, it also affected our own lives too. Sometimes, people don't sleep at night, and when they wake up, they get more, and they don't talk to people; so after that, they won't get a social life, and at the end of the day, they get depressed, and that affects the mental health of a person. In conclusion, social life could affect everybody;  only you choose whether you want a positive change or a negative change.
Social media has become the biggest platform that people use for many reasons. Some like to escape reality by creating a safe space for themselves, and others can make an actual living out of posting advertisements as well as gaining a huge following. It isn't a secret that our world is being built around social media. This means it must have a huge influence on not just individuals but our society too. The effect it has can be either positive or negative, depending on how you look at it. The way I see it is that a lot of job opportunities are being offered to people with a huge following. Let's say, for example, a person has a million followers on Instagram; he/she can make thousands of dollars by just posting one advertisement for a certain company. Another positive effect social media has is that it makes spreading news or awareness very easy. For example, climate change has been the hot topic on many social media platforms as awareness about it is spreading fast. I think that it's things like this that make me glad our world has social media. However, we must not ignore all the negative and dangerous outcomes from using social media too much, such as privacy invasion, depression, lack of communication and many more. I believe if we are careful with our usage of social media, it wouldn't do us much harm.
Social media is one of the most important haunts on the Internet. Social media offers  people to reconnect with their old friends and make new friends, and it can help us to study online and take courses, and we can use it to  help; it has a big effect on everyone  nowadays; there is not a single person without Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter.... etc. People use their phone to communicate more than to visit them or talk in person. These days, there is no child or grown-up  without a smartphone; moreover, there are positive sides and negative sides; unfortunately, there is  cyberbullying and online harassment; if you're not very careful, some people tend to pick on people just for some fun reasons on the Internet. There is also an impact on privacy; if we are not careful about what we post on the Internet, it can come back and hunt you. Revealing personal information is bad, for example, photos and videos... They can take them,  blackmail you and all of that, and if you open your location, some may stalk you. In conclusion, social media has its advantages and disadvantages; it's up to each person how to use social media wisely to enhance their personal and social life.
 In modern society, social media is inevitably a very important part of our daily lives. Almost everybody in every part of the world has some form of social media; it can be used for personal uses but can also be used in some  workplaces. It is a great tool for keeping families who live in different parts of the world connected or spreading news and raising awareness about important issues. However, along with the benefits and undeniable advantages that social media has provided, there are some negative consequences that also come with the widespread use of social media. Many celebrities are on social media and obviously have a huge number of followers. They show their extravagant and seemingly perfect lives to the public; this can have quite the impact on normal people, causing them to compare themselves to these people and wonder why they cannot  have a perfect body or expensive car, and this can sometimes, sadly, lead  people - the younger generation especially - to develop unhealthy eating habits or a lifestyle to try and achieve what they are seeing on social media. Another issue that is caused by social media is  cyberbullying. Social media has made it incredibly easy to bully a person online, and this can have devastating results on the person on the receiving end, and this can cause distrust and hatred to fester within a community. That being said, I personally think that if we all use social media to spread positivity and use it to raise awareness of pressing issues, then it could do the world a favor.
 Social media is a great way in which the world communicates today; it encourages globalisation and promotes communication between people, no matter where they are in the world. It also helped society evolve at a faster rate, and many benefits come along with this, such as being more aware and understanding cultures at a deeper level than one would normally do. Before the Internet and social media, communicating with people who were far away took days,  if not weeks. The telegram was one of the inventions developed in the late 18th century that helped inspire receiving important messages fast, which in turn resulted in talking to someone only requiring a push of a button  nowadays. However, with benefits also come disadvantages; the media is a powerful asset that contributes to people's perception of certain topics; and although some of the information on social media might be false or incorrect, it changes people's opinions, and many are manipulated by the mass media. Furthermore, social media presents unrealistic goals of how people should look and lead their lives, which may affect an individual negatively as people can spread hate easily due to the fact that they can hide behind a screen, which can result in depression, anxiety and many more issues.
Social media is a very controversial subject nowadays. First of all, what is social media exactly? Social media is an online web or app that people use to connect with others and post pictures and videos. People of most age groups use social media, starting from  10-year-olds  up to adults. Social media has its positive and negative effects on individuals and society. To begin with, social media has the most effect on younger age groups, such as teenagers and young adults, mostly since they are the most vulnerable. It has the most effect    on the younger age group, and it is mostly negative because younger people tend to follow big influencers; and as  normal human beings, those people would want to own the things that celebrities own; they want to have the same body, face shape and nose as that celebrity, which lowers the younger group's  self-confidence and causes depression in some cases. On the other hand, older age groups usually aren't affected by influencers and celebrities because they are older and wiser; in other words, they know better. As for the effect of social media on society as a whole, it definitely has opened the people's minds and raised awareness about many things, yet it still has a bad influence on younger people within the society.
How many of you are addicted to social media and can't go a day without being on social media? Social media   nowadays has a huge impact on our life. It has taken over the world. It has its negatives and positives in our society. First of all, social media may affect individuals, but not as much as it affects our society; people are getting addicted in bad ways, which is affecting their personal life, such as their families and their work life.  Social media has lots of positives; like communicating has been so much easier. People are relying on social media for a lot of things. Second, it has huge negatives in our society. There are people that are using social media in the wrong way, especially that social media is open around the world and has no control, so such bad users can represent the society in a bad way; and  research showed that people are mostly using social media during their work time, which affects the society in different ways. In conclusion, people should watch out for theirselves  when using social media and be more careful about it, and they have to know how to control between their life and being on social media.
Social media Social media is a big part of each  individual; with one touch, you can change so much. With social media coming into  our lives, there are  pros and cons. Some of the pros are that you can help people overseas  and also learn on social media; it's such a powerful  thing; you can do so many things, while some of the cons are that maybe people are at war, and they are using social media in some apps - you can track that person, and that can affect a disaster. A person can pretend to be someone else on social media and so many other things. We can't deny that social media helped us and developed so much; for example, instead of going and buying books, you can download them on your phone; you can facetime your friends that live a long way from you and also use social media to learn and educate  yourself. With one click, you can either develop something useful or destroy something. In my opinion, I think everybody that is using social media should be careful and not put their whole life out there on social media, and people should use it the right way. Overall, social media is such an amazing thing that happened to us that makes life so much easier in some way.
Social media affects individuals and  society in a lot of different ways that can be negative or positive. The positive thing that social media can do is to make us smarter; like for example, we can find anything we want online; you can search for anything you want to learn about, like science,  math, English and anything you can think of. Social media also helps us to see what is going on in the world, like  sports, the government and any type of news you would like to know about. Social media also helps us to communicate with our friends and family  anywhere in the world, which really helps if you're missing anyone; like for example, if your mom is away, you can use social media to talk to her, and that helps a lot. However, if we don't use social media wisely and carefully, it can have a lot of negative effects on the society. A lot of  cyberbullying happens on social media because some people find it as an easy way to target someone and send them cruel messages. Another bad thing is that people can become very addicted to their phone to use social media, especially teenagers, which affects them in their real social life. It can also affect them in a negative way in their school life because their brain will want to think about social media and when  the lesson will finish so they could go straight away to their phones. In my opinion, I think social media has a balance between positive and negative, and it can be more of a positive thing if we use it properly; like make time for everything and balance your social media life and your normal life.
The UAE is one of the  countries that mostly use technology and artificial intelligence a lot. This is very important for the level of the country, especially from the economic side. Nowadays, the most important development in the UAE is using artificial intelligence in everything. Artificial intelligence is really important for the future, and it is connected to all jobs. Most students study this major when they join the university. However, this major needs a lot of hard work because it is related to engineering and technology. On the other hand, I joined Zayed University, and this university does not have this major, but I am sure that after a few years, all the universities in the UAE will include an artificial intelligence major. Artificial intelligence can develop our knowledge and skills, which improves our future.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media is something everyone uses - parents, teenagers, grandparents and also children; there are many ways to use social media - some advertise and some view the advertisement; there are advantages and disadvantages to using social media. There are several advantages to using social media: fashionistas advertise for some companies and get paid for the advertisement, parents will keep  track of what's happening in the society, teenagers might follow a businessman  and learn how to invest and start a business for themselves and kids learn a lot of stuff; nowadays, kids know more than most of us, teenagers, because they learn in a fun way by spending time on social media. Let's not forget about the disadvantages; some teenagers use social media in the wrong way by watching inappropriate videos, talking to strangers and giving them information they're not supposed to know and even bullying others online. Kids might spend all their time on social media instead of spending most of their time playing outside with their friends or doing something creative - maybe learning to cook and bake. We have to try and prevent others and ourselves from using the social media in the wrong way; parents should spend more time with their kids to tell them what's wrong and what's right and to ask them about what they do on social media and who they follow.
 These past few years have been a huge advantage for technology since they are the years in which technology has changed and developed, and one of these developments that came from technology was social media. Social media has been here since the start of the 21st century; therefore, it's the beginning of a new era. There are many ways social media could affect individuals as well as  society (there could be advantages and disadvantages). Many people may consider social media as a good way of expressing yourself and your beliefs, but others see how it could affect people to have an extremely high standard of living a lifestyle that they can't afford or is not for them. Therefore, people could get affected by social media in a way that's unhealthy, and it could actually mentally damage them; for example, the beauty standard that's aiming towards teenage girls that they should always look presentable, thin and beautiful could lead to mental illnesses, like anorexia, bulimia and depression, because they could never be like the pictures of the girls that are on social media. There are also many advantages to social media, where people could actually voice their beliefs and opinions rather than being silenced - it could be politically, comedically or even just talking about your day and expressing your emotions. It's a good way of venting to other people or just putting it out there. Social media is also great for raising awareness and letting people know what's going on in the world, for example, the climate change that's been happening and the near extinction of turtles because of plastic, where  raising awareness on social media  decreased the use of plastic straws, which made society and the individuals aware of their surroundings rather than living in their own little bubble. In conclusion, social media has its advantages and disadvantages for society and  individuals.
Nowadays, people consider social media their most trusted form and see what's trending on these sites to spread information, but these people don't realize how social media ruined our view of life. People nowadays believe everything they see on social media sites, and that helped a lot of people start or bring back their careers but also ruined a lot of others whom people pointed at with false accusations. People stopped relying on TV and newspapers to get information as they started using social media since it is a much faster platform and because they don't have to search because news gets trended easily, and people can check the latest updates. However, the platform that trends news immediately ruined the lives of a lot of people, and an example of that is a Chinese model who did a photoshoot without knowing what the company advertised and only found out after seeing the poster of her with a guy and children who were supposedly unattractive, implying that the parents got a plastic surgery, and that's why their children didn't look attractive; but after that, the Chinese model trended for something she was falsely accused of, which stopped her career completely as companies didn't want to hire someone with a bad reputation. Although the public didn't do anything more than write hateful comments about her, the model's career got ruined because of the media play and because people believed things before making sure that what they're spreading is true.
Social media has a huge impact on a person's life and the society, whether it was positive or negative. As an individual, it is your choice  how you'd like to use it. For example, if you spend a lot of time on social media, you are basically spending your day on your phone, laptop, etc., when instead, you could be doing something else, like hanging out with your friends and family, reading a book or even helping out. What you choose to post and whom you choose to follow could impact you mentally. If you choose to follow accounts that you know will affect you, you could start feeling bad about yourself, but if you choose to follow accounts that make you happy, for example, pet accounts, it could make you happier; but not only does social media affect an individual; it could affect your society. The way you choose how to display and talk about your country, for example, would have an effect on the people of your country as well. Not only  your country has access to the Internet, but almost the entire world. Although social media could have a bad effect on society, sometimes, it actually could be very helpful sometimes. People often raise awareness and post useful things that could help you with your life and your studies. Choose your words and what you decide to post wisely.
Social media plays a big part in this generation's life; it is the main platform where people share their activities and maybe some of their personal lives and also  business; but how do we know when it affects us or each person individually? Everything in life has its bad  sides and good ones, so it is logical for these online platforms to own the same concept. If a person knows how to use social media in a good way, then there will not be any harm to the society. People tend to share positive messages, enjoyable trips and also some tips on how to survive life; but as I said before, everything in life has its own downfalls. A lot of people that live in this world at this time mostly share some bad intentions or behaviors. They tend to send out harmful messages or bad examples to the youth, which can lead to damaging a person's life. For example, bullying plays one of the huge factors in this generation's hardships and negative emotions, like depression or low self-esteem. It does not really matter whether it is one person behind a screen or multiple ones; it would surely scare them in their life. That is why we should always keep an eye on how the children of this century use technology or any use of social platforms because either they affect others or others affect them. At the very last, no one can stay away from social media. It is a very effective and addicting use of technology. We just need to know how to use it so we can send out positive outcomes to the people out there, and also we benefit from it ourselves.
Social media is an unstable ride for an individual; it's really that easy for social media to get you depressed,  extremely happy or simply just confused. The way you browse social media is really important; it will allow you to have a great time or the total opposite. As an individual, I see that Twitter and Facebook are the  two social media sites that mostly affect others so easily - whether positively or negatively; it's easy to let others get affected by your opinion or for you to get affected by their opinion. Another thing we should all keep in mind is that nowadays, most of the communication is done through online sites, which sometimes leads to chaos out of a misunderstood text or even doing anything wrong without knowing that it's actually wrong. The social media leaves  unlimited access for you to throw in your thoughts, and you might get judged, and you might not. It's really important as a user to know the safest way to be on social media without it affecting you badly - nor you getting addicted - or simply changing you as a person into the version you never thought you would be one day. Be wise and browse safely.
Have you ever heard about social media and how  it affects individuals and society? Most of the people around the world use social media; they use it in their daily life routine. A lot of people are addicted to social media, and it's really scary; it's so addictive that people can't live without it, and they use it every day and spend hours on their phones. Social media is really effective for adults and children, and there are a lot of negative things that happen on social media. There are a lot of negative ways people use their social media, like cyberbullying and a lot of negative things; people use it to communicate with other people around the world and to know more about cultures and the way  people think; they can also have their own business on social media.  Most of them use social media to entertain themselves and to waste their time so the time would go faster. A lot of them use it in the wrong way; they bully others; they sometimes share others' privacy so they can get  revenge by hurting and sharing others' privacy. There's a lot of effective things people do on social media. People should start thinking wisely and know how to use social media in a good way; they also should talk about it with their children and tell them how to use it in a good way. Most of the parents don't think about it, and they ignore the fact that social media might affect their children and the way they're thinking.
Social media has become the most thing that is  taking up all of our time; it has a few disadvantages and a few advantages. The few disadvantages are that it could be taking up our time, and it could be distracting us from the important things, like education or spending time with our family; it could also be bad because of spending too much time caring about your likes on Instagram or the number of followers you have; you'd be forgetting to live your life the way you want to. Although there are also a few advantages to social media, like sharing pictures with your family/friends who are abroad,  you can also be checking the news and what's going on in our world - the good news or the bad news. In conclusion, I believe social media could affect a lot of people, but it just depends on the way they like to use it or the way they view things from their perspectives - whether good or bad; it all depends on the person doing it. Some people may be doing it because of what other people like to see, and as I mentioned above, they would be forgetting to enjoy their lives because they focus too much on what others want to see.
Social media affects individuals and  society in so many different ways; in general, spending too much time on a daily basis on social networks could adversely affect your mood and health. Social media could cause anxiety and depression if it was consumed more than the average;  however, by using social media in a good way, it would affect you drastically and will be helpful to the person and the society. People use social media for many things, such as socializing and finding information, which tends to be the most popular of them all; sometimes it's good, and sometimes it's bad. Social media can improve your knowledge and make studying easier. Back in the days, people used books to find the information they need, but now they have Google, which does most of the work; this is one of the many positives of social media. The negatives that the social media offers are  cyberhacking and  cyberbullying, which  are major crimes.  Cyberbullying could cause some mental issues, such as destroyed self-confidence and the feeling of harassment by others. In my opinion, I think that social media is such a good thing which is so helpful; however, everything has the good and the bad, so we don't rely on just social media; we also need to socialize in real life.
Most of the people nowadays use social media, but not all of them use it in a proper way. It has advantages, like communicating with people, using your free time, improving your reading skills and many others. In the other hand, it also has disadvantages; like it may cause weakness in the eyes and some physical problems; it weakens family relationships. Families send their children outside of the country to study; they communicate with each other to ask about their child and how he is doing through social media; and friends also communicate with each other from other countries and far distances. Using your free time on social media is a good way to know what is happening around you and in the world. You can get news and information easily while sitting in your place, without waiting for someone to tell you or even waiting for the programs to start. Sometimes, you don't find books in the library, so the only way to get them is by reading them online; in this way, you can improve your reading skills. One of the big advantages is health problems because most of them have no cure, like the hunchbacked people and also the eye, which is the most important thing in humans. Families want to sit together to share their moments and emotions, but when children connect to Wi-Fi, they forget everything around them and don't care about anyone; in this way, every family member sits alone without the other. In conclusion, you may use it in the right way to improve many things and communicate with people from far away, and you can also use it in the wrong way and cause problems for yourself.
Social media Social media is life; this is how people see it; it's all about the  life behind screens that affects people and everyone around. Firstly, people use social media as if it's something pretty important, but it's not, really; it affects them the other way around; people can't see how social life on the Internet affects their life, but others do; you can see how people bury their faces in their phones all day long. Well, also,  you can see how many people use glasses or eye contacts because of those screens. Social life affects the amount of enjoyment in life; it makes people enjoy less of their life cause they don't live the moment anymore. You can see everything in peoples' life on social media - their whole life in pictures and videos; you think that's how they feel; the fake smile is not life anymore - not really; it's just a pretty lie, for example, a lady takes a really nice picture  online to show off how much money she spends on  herself with debt; that's how it goes for social media in people's life. Secondly, society gets really affected by social media; let me tell you how. People around really just ruin everything for  better social internet things. People around never communicate unless it's on phones; you can't see people around in parks; jungles are burning just for a better look. Let me tell you that the Amazon is burning down, and what people do is snap it and tweet it without any action to save the world. At the end, look for your life cause it's lost on social media; give yourself and others a better life and a better future.   
Social media Nowadays, a lot of us use social media in their daily life; it becomes an important thing that everyone can't get over. It, of course, has an effect on society and individuals. Social media has positive effects and negative effects on society - positive effects, such as making a more social and collaborating society and letting the society be more aware of the new news and events, and negative effects, such as receiving wrong news from social media and causing hate between countries. It also has positive effects and negative effects on people; the positive effects are like learning about different cultures and traditions, having an easy way to communicate with others and being informed about what is going on around you; it has a lot of creative things and ideas that can help you,  and it also can help you with your homework, tasks and projects. Social media can have negative effects on people because it can be a waste of time; it causes bad effects to your mental and physical health, and  sometimes, it keeps you distanced from your family because you are busy on social media and not giving attention to your family. Finally, there are a lot of things that social media has for us - both positive and negative, and I hope you take the positive side and the benefits of it and are aware of the negatives.
Social media affects individuals and  society immensely. Social media is a site that everyone around the world can access,  where they can talk to each other through a screen; it notifies you about everything that happens around the world - if there is a fight happening, an event and everything you can imagine, but the question is how does it affect us? Social media affects us in both ways - either in a positive or in a negative way. It lets you communicate with your friends  anytime and anywhere, which will let you feel that you're not alone; for example, if your parents are traveling and you're home alone, you can text them, check if they are doing well and update them with what's happening with your life. Twitter  lets you express your feeling; you can just tweet anything you'd like, and maybe you'll find someone who's going through the same situation you're going through. If you have a group project, social media makes it easier to communicate with each other and finish the project faster. These are some of the things through which social media affects us positively, while in the negative aspect, it causes social bullying; anyone around the world can come to your account and start to bully you, and that may cause suicide and many things. Social media causes people to get stuck on their phones all the time and forget about what's happening around them; they can spend the time they spent on their phone with their family and do productive work instead of wasting it all on their phones. To conclude, it depends on the person how social media affects them, either in a negative way or in a positive way (or maybe even in both).
In today's world, social media is the most popular thing that everyone is using  to communicate with each other around the world, and in this essay, I will explain how it affects us in a good and a bad way as a society. Firstly, through the social media apps, we can see a lot of different kinds of social media users (fashion bloggers, vloggers, etc.) that provide us with different ideas, but at the same time, some accounts might include some bad subjects, which is not polite for others. For example, a few people, whom we call """cyberbullies""," create a huge account with a lot of views to bully the popular people,       and this affects those who are getting bullied in a negative way. Secondly, the social media got another disadvantage, which is common between the teenagers or, generally, the students, and using social media is distracting them during the classes; also, at  home, they might forget to finish their work, and that will lead them to miss the deadlines, so their grades will decrease, and it will prevent them from achieving their goals and from succeeding. In the other hand, social media got a lot of advantages, such as helping us to get to know a lot of people and to make  friendships in other countries, which benefits us to know more about different cultures. In addition, we can spend our free time scrolling through the social media, and that is a fun thing to do to get out of the stress after a long tiring day, so you can play games, chat with your friend and  know the recent news about what is happening in the world. In my opinion, even though I used to think that social media is a waste of time, I  realized that no one can stop using it since it has been a very important part of our daily life.
Social media has a big impact on individuals' life. Every day, many people struggle because of the bad influence social media has, not only on adults but on children and teenagers too. It is very dangerous and affects people's minds negatively. Although social media has its  downfalls, it also is the biggest source of communication and knowledge. It's a great way for people in the same society to share thoughts, connect and share ideas and cultures. Social media starts by poisoning individuals' minds, and that slowly affects their children then community. There's a way people can control the effect social media has on them and on their community, and it's by taking good care of each other,  not using as much social media and  also not believing everything on the Internet; it's a good way of saving peoples' lives. Social media has been causing fights and chaos between couples, friends and even families! Together, we can  help reduce that effect by staying strong and sticking   together instead of standing up against each other. A great way not to  let the Internet affect you is by reducing the time of using it; instead of texting somebody, go to their house.
The United Arab Emirates is one of the countries that has changed drastically in around 50 years only. Because of Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan's clear vision, and with the help of his brothers - the presidents of the other emirates, all together, they have taken the country to another level of development in all aspects. One of the most important aspects of development is education, which is the base of every other type of development that had occurred in this country. In the past, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan considered education as the base of what he had in mind and where he would like to see the United Arab Emirates in the coming years. Schools were built all around the country. Boys and girls were receiving education from highly educated teachers coming from the Middle East and few western countries as well. Students to Sheikh Zayed were the real investment. He said once, """The" real investment isn't in fuel or pearls but in the youth of this "country.""" He provided education, schools, universities, and  highly educated teachers and professors and believed in his people. All of that in the past took the United Arab Emirates to the point it is at right now. In conclusion, I think development starts from education, and all efforts you put in education are never a waste but a way of growing into a better individual.
Social media is  essential to human beings as it is a way to communicate with your surroundings as well as people from different parts of the world. I'm going to demonstrate my thoughts on how it affects individuals and  society. To start off, influencers play a huge part in social media because they're considered role models, which leads to individuals replicating their personality or lifestyle. Moreover, it can affect the people negatively or positively. Another point to add is that society has shown a variety of personalities, styles and humour, which is because of social media. People are finding their interests, friendships and long-term happiness on social media. This does not only bond different societies, but also cuts discrimination and racism. People are getting well educated, knowing the limits to what they can say online and how much they can say. They've become more aware of what's happening around the world, like global warming, natural hazards and poverty. Human beings have gained skills that will benefit them and their future. To sum up, although it can affect individuals and societies in a negative way, there are a lot of things that positively impact the people, which led to many solutions and cooperation.
Social media is important for communicating with other individuals in the modern world. However, it has multiple disadvantages for the individuals and the society that we live in; in the other hand, there are also multiple advantages, such as communicating with family, making friends overseas, learning about many different cultures in the world and sharing knowledge with people across the world. Social media can affect people who are not aware and mindful of their habits on social media and what they view on it and who use it in a negative way, such as abusing,  cyberbullying and stealing personal information. Many individuals nowadays  are addicted to their phones, specifically to social media; and on a bigger scale, how does it affect society in some cultures, such as our culture, with a lot of concentration on other cultures? It affects it sometimes in a negative way, especially when you don't know a lot about your own culture; you tend more towards other cultures.
Social media became vital in every individual's life; it is a weapon with two sides, and it can be used in different ways. Most of them use it for entertainment and enjoyment, some use it for beneficial reasons, such as marketing  products, and others for socializing with people around the world. Social media can affect the society in a positive or negative way based on the way it is used in the community. In my opinion, using those social media applications can harm the society, and especially the young generation. Since it is known that teenagers are addicted to social media, it is the parents' role to limit the time they spend on those websites. Social media plays an important role in one's mental and physical health. It may limit the growth of the mind and body since people get engaged to their devices and never know when they should stop. The dangerous side of this weapon is that it could lead to many problems, such as bullying that may lower the self-esteem of an individual. In addition, social media can stop creative people from thinking and developing their skills, which may lead to low financial growth in the country. In conclusion, it is the individual's choice if he/she would spend hours on useless devices or help in the development of his/her country.
Social media has a lot of impacts on each person and on the society.  In this essay, I will discuss the main effects on them.  Firstly,  the social media has affected a lot of people, where some of them had a positive effect   and the others  a negative effect,  and we can estimate this through the years.  The positive effect that the person has been affected by on the social media is that he/she can promote  themself if they have a business or something they do, and they want other people to see  and appreciate, so they feel happy and confident and try to improve themself. The positive effect on the society is being more socialized with people and promoting  other people's businesses, and that leads to  strong and good relationships between each other. Secondly,  just like  the social media has a positive effect, it also has a negative effect, which is not specifying the people's ranges, such as children,  youth,  teenagers and adults who have to sign up for these applications because if all of the people have signed up,  there will not be a limit for uploading things; maybe a child could not see according to his/her old range. In conclusion,  social media has a positive and a negative effect that affects  each person and affects the society, in general. 
It really affects us!!  Do you love sitting on your phone? How often do you use it? Did you ever try to count the hours that you sit on it every week? I think that it will be unbelievable for you if you saw the results. In fact, most people spend so much time on it, while their thoughts are telling them that it is still too short, and it is still too early to leave it now. Actually, that might be a bigger problem because some people say that they are using it individually, so they are not responsible for other ones. However, the truth says that they cannot be  just responsible for them, but also the main reason for this to be common in the society day by day. At the end of this, we should all be aware and think again carefully when we start using social media. And you must know that the way you are using it, whether good or bad, will affect you and all people. My mom used to tell me this all the time, but the more I grow up, the more I understand what she was trying to make me understand.
Social media is the most popular thing that is happening around the world these days; it made people's lives  easier through communication, shopping online, education or even knowing the news that is happening in other countries. Social media helped individuals and society in several different ways, but not everything is positive in the social media world; of course, there would be some negative effects. Sometimes, social media can ruin face-to-face   communications; for example, people would be lazy to meet up or even visit their loved ones because they would rely on social media and text each other, which is sad; another negative effect that might happen to any person is bullying on social media, which  has a name:    """cyberbullying""." Spreading rumors on social media is also a big negative effect on the society. It's important that people should balance their time between the  time  they spend with their families and social media. Social media has both pros and cons that affect  either individuals or society. As I said, social media is the most popular thing that is happening nowadays, but people should try and avoid anything negative that would happen, and everything would be great.
Social media is one of the most important things in our life, and it is essential to our living. Like any other thing, social media has its advantages and disadvantages, and it affects everyone around us - adults, elders and even kids. We use social media to entertain  ourselves and forget about the people around us - our friends and family; we stopped communicating and doing activities together; our biggest concern now is what people are posting or where the celebrities are. Some of the advantages of social media are that it makes you connect with other people around the world, and it improves your knowledge about things you're interested in, and it's also helpful for educational purposes. Sometimes,  it helps you know what's going on around the world. Some of the disadvantages are the lack of communication within yourself; you forget about people and focus on things that are not important in your life, and it could also affect your study; you would be too distracted and forget to study or do your assignments. Some people even get addicted to social media, which could cause  eyesight problems, back problems and many other things. Everyone should use social media in a way that it wouldn't affect their personal or social life, and we should learn not to abuse it; especially with children, parents have to monitor and see what their kids are doing because they would be mostly affected at a very young age; they wouldn't know what's right and wrong, which could result in bad habits. Thank you.
Some people say that social media is a bad thing for our society - some agree, some don't; but is it really bad, or is it good? I am going to write about how social media affects us as a society and  individuals. Social media can be very helpful and also can be so dangerous; it can help you connect with people who live miles away, and it helps people to make new friends from other countries; also, some people start a business on social media, which is so helpful; also, it helps people to know what is going on in other countries and what is happening in the world.  However, social media is not all so happy and positive. On the other side, there is a very negative side to social media, which can destroy other people's lives. For example, some people post inappropriate posts on social media, which can get in the hands of kids and destroy their innocent mind; also, your private life can get leaked easily, which can mess up your mental health, just like  cyberbullying, which is so common on social media, and nobody is trying to stop it even when there are a lot of people who took their own life because of it, and I think we should all try to think of ways that  can stop it. Personally, I think it depends on you; you could use social media in a healthy and pretty positive way, or you can destroy your life and others by getting on the negative side, while I wish everyone would avoid getting on the negative side.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media can affect positively and negatively sometimes. Social media is a good thing to use, but some people use it in a wrong or harmful way. When you bully people, or if you keep posting  improper pictures or videos on social media, that may cause rumors. Social media can make you interact and communicate with people from all around the world, and by that, you can know what's new from all the countries, and you can also communicate with your siblings if they're far away from you. You can show people your culture and your daily routine and share it with them, and they will be more knowledgeable about your country and what's happening with you. There are a lot of rumors and bullying that is done by people who use social media in the wrong way. Social media affects the society in a lot of ways; you can put your latest news and spread your word with only one post or tweet on social media. Everyone uses social media nowadays, so it will be easy if you wanna announce something. The society uses social media positively most of the time, and that's a good thing to do instead of spreading rumors.
As we know, everything has a good and bad side. People use social media in many ways and for many things, such as knowing each other, sharing information or even searching for it;  on the other hand, social media could be stressful or give negative emotions. Social media has helped and hurt the society; it can improve or destroy the society.  Another way that it can affect  the society is that it can affect politics and business as well; some of the negative effects come from  cyberbullying.  Let's take a look at how  it affects the person; well, it affects  them in many ways; people nowadays chat on the phones; they don't see each other in real life or even have time for each other; it also affects  the person's behavior. Social media can also steal our sleep from us; it also increases the amount of anxiety and stress. The risk that many of us need to be aware of is cyberbullying. As I mentioned before, it decreases face-to-face   communication, reduces family closeness, causes distraction and lacks emotional connection.  People who are addicted to social media may experience negative side effects, such as eye strain and stress, so it has a negative impact on your health. We should use social media less and work on socializing more;  we can all change that bad habit to something new and good; we should care more about our time,  learn new things and do new things rather than stalk people or just sit for hours on social media;  we have to make a change!
Social media is a big thing nowadays; it is what people use to communicate and share their daily life. Some people use it in a negative way; they will bully others or threaten them by letting them  give them money or other things, and if the person didn't do that, they may get their information leaked or get death threats, but others use it to communicate with others who live far away or share some positive photos of family or nature. In this day and age, social media can be some people's  work; they get paid to do sponsorship or modeling - the more followers the more income you get. In some way, social media makes people isolated in some world where they can stay hours and hours scrolling on Instagram or watching YouTube videos. It is bad for a person not to communicate with others face to face because it will lower your confidence and  self-esteem. Social media can make you feel lonely, but at the same time, you can meet people on it, but you never know until you meet them in person.  In conclusion, you need to be careful when using social media; don't be on it for a long time; talk to people in person to see their body language.
Social media and its effect Social media has been the main thing in our lives nowadays; everyone of  all different ages is using social media for almost everything, and it has gotten to a point where our days can't function properly without social media. We use it to communicate, to calculate, to navigate and to help us in many other things, whether it was necessary or not; and without further  ado, let's get to how it affects us as individuals and as a whole community. First, I'll start by saying that social media is addictive; people get addicted to using social media, whether they were young or old. Moreover, that leads us to the first effect on individuals. Social media might get us addicted to the point where we get distracted, frustrated and worried without it; the intensity of this might change from one person to another, but it still is affecting  most people. On the other hand, it can have a positive effect too, like functioning during the day more efficiently and quickly; we calculate faster, we don't get lost and we contact our loved ones more easily. Being an individual is also being a part of a community; there are small communities or big communities - small like a group of friends or family and big like a whole country or region. Therefore, whatever an individual goes through or does might also affect the whole community he's in. Now we all are individuals, and social media has its effect on us as individuals already, but how did that affect us as a whole community then? First, as families or groups of friends, we started getting distant and distracted by our phones and social media accounts during gatherings, but if we look at it from a wider perspective - as a whole community in a country, the positive effect is taking over since we connect to the outer world faster, and we share our cultures more openly; that made our civilizations connected, and it took a bigger step into creating better generations. In conclusion, having social media in our lives will surely have its effect on us, whether we wanted it or not. I personally think it's not something we control, but we are all in this together, so taking in the effect of social media doesn't matter, but what actually matters is how we take it in - do we choose to make it a positive effect or a negative one? Because of this, it's all up to us and what we choose.
Effects of social media Social media is applications or websites people use to communicate and share interests, and it  has a lot of effects on individuals and society; these effects can be either negative or positive, depending on the way you use social media. Social media can help you save a lot of time and effort; it also can enrich your brain with a numerous amount of information about other cultures. Using social media, you can connect with the other half of the world by a click of a button. Social media can also help in the process of learning; it makes education so much easier; instead of searching in books that will never end, you can type whatever  you are looking for, and you will find all the information you need in a blink of an eye. On the other hand, there are also a lot of negative effects, including health issues; these issues can be either mental or physical. Using social media a lot can cause anxiety and depression; it also affects your physical health by having sight problems. Social media can have a huge negative impact on society if it was not used properly; citizens might lose their national identity and forget their traditions and cultures, which are a big part of the society and what makes it unique and different. As I mentioned before, social media is a strong, effective weapon that you can decide whether to use  for your advantage, or it might turn against you; and in my opinion, it has a lot more positive effects than negatives, so be wise and use it correctly.
Title: Effects of social media on individuals and society In the past years, some programs were created and emerged in the world for individuals to use as a tool for communication, and they were named as social media programs. These programs are  Snapchat, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. These programs had a great effect on both individuals and society in both ways, negative and positive. For the positive aspect, social media facilitated the way of communication. It made it easier for individuals in the society to communicate with other individuals through these programs through calls or even text. People started using these apps because, other than being easy to use, they also offer free phone and video calls so people won't have to pay  the companies that offer paid calls. Moreover, social media programs made it easier for people to spread information or spread aspects of cultures. Social media programs made it easy for people to access information of individuals all over the world, and that helped in the increase of globalization. On the other hand, social media also has some negative effects on the individuals and the society. Because of these programs, people started to prefer to communicate with others online only and not face to face because they find it easier to express their feelings. This kills their social skills and makes them become antisocial. Furthermore, people tend to spend more time with themselves alone using social media rather than spending it with other people and even their family members. This tends to also ruin the relationships between family members. As a conclusion, social media affected individuals and  society a lot and in both ways - negative and positive. It is true that almost everyone in the world uses social media, and it affects everyone, but the individual using it can decide whether to use it in good terms or bad terms and watch whether its effect is positive or negative according to their decision.
When the topic comes to social media, everyone  has an opinion on the subject. Before we start with how social media is bad for the society and everyone,  let's begin with why we use it and how it helped us. The most and best feature is """communication"";" it's what keeps us connected in these times with the changing world  and everything;  people have lost the touch of communication with others; even close people lost that too.  Nowadays, people can talk,  facetime  and communicate with one touch of a button; all those difficulties that were barriers in their way have been solved by social media; and another factor is that everyone  can have knowledge in their hand and see the world through their screen. Instead of going from a book to a book, just to do your projects, instead, you just can google what you're looking for, and you will find it in a matter of seconds, and that saves your time to do other things in your life and to do more because looking for knowledge takes a lot from you without  social media; but the other bad side of the social media is how you use it because not everyone  has the best intentions on it; like we have hackers and terrorism that makes [INCOMPLETE]
The UAE has done a lot of developments in the past years starting from 1971, when Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan started ruling the seven emirates and Sheikh Rashid, the ruler of Dubai, was by his side;  however, it developed rapidly from only riding camels to any transportation in the world, such as water taxis, Dubai Metro, cars and planes;  but most importantly: security; the UAE is known as the safest country in the world,  thanks to the police;  they don't even have to carry weapons;  this is how  safe it is; and I'm proud that my passport is the first and strongest passport in the world. However, millions of tourists come from all around the world to see and experience my country to enjoy the biggest fountain in Dubai,  the best hotels, the beach and the malls. Looking back at the past, I kind of miss the old days, where we used to live in small houses and tents, where we all stay together as a family,  but that did not affect our culture. The UAE does every year a festival - the """Umm" Al "Emarat""" Festival - in which we share and save our culture and tradition from disappearing. In my opinion, I would like to help to keep developing my country in the future.  Thank you, Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
Social media has  good effects and bad effects on our society. It can help some people and destroy some others. Social media is basically apps or whatever that we use on our phones, such as Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat,  WhatsApp and many more.  Nowadays, individuals have more  bad effects from the social media because in the last years, we have witnessed a lot of suicides by people having a really bad depression, or even some kids are doing bad things to their health; the reason why people are having depression and suiciding goes back to the social media; people are being cyberbullied. Cyberbullying is saying bad things to a friend online or spreading hate and rumors about an individual that will cause them a hard time, and as I said, there are small kids  watching YouTube and other things and want to act or do like them; for example, they see a YouTube video - """Try" to Steal From a Store Without Letting People Notice "You""," and kids try to steal from the stores. Well, the good thing about the social media effect is that there are people now studying online - and that's good for them - kids  watching a video to learn how to solve a math problem and people learning how to cook or make a beautiful cake to go to a friend's house, so people are learning from social media. To sum up, it's obvious that it has a good and a bad effect on individuals, and it's all up to the person whether he/she wants to use it in a good way and benefit from it or take it to the bad side and let others suffer from it; it's all up to the person that's using it. 
The world has developed, and so many things showed up and made our lives much easier; one of the most popular examples is social media. Social media made our lives easier by contacting the world while you are at your home; but not just that, it also made us know what's happening in the world, but we forget that the social media may also affect  individuals and society. To be more clear, how does social media affect? First, if we just talk about how  it affects  one person, we will find too many things, like phones and  admiring  social media; it may affect the person's personality, it can make them feel or be alone and also, it may make them  dislike to have friends in the real world; furthermore, the person may lose the face-to-face   connection and let his personality be so weak. Every person will be more active on social media, but in the real life, they are like dead people; visiting their family, seeing them and talking to them face to face   don't matter to the person who admires the social media; he will prefer to talk to them online. Second, when we think that every person in the society may be alone and doesn't express  himself, that will affect the society so badly; everyone will stay far from the other person; it  doesn't matter if you didn't see anyone in real life; there will be no love and no gatherings that our grandfathers and mothers teach us to do;  the most important thing that we will lose is that we will not know each other enough. Social media made our lives easy, but also it affected the world and people in so many things.
Impacts of social media Over the past few years, a huge improvement and growth of social media has been noticed in the society. Social media is a source of entertainment and communication and an important source to benefit from. Social media affects individuals and  society in many ways (positively and negatively). Individuals all over the world -   kids, teenagers and adults - use social media. Social media has a very positive impact on the society. One effect is that social media has become the number-one  source of entertainment worldwide. People spend their free time scrolling through social media applications to have some fun. Another useful use of social media is that it is a really convenient and fast source of communication. It makes it easier for people all around the world to communicate and be in touch in only a matter of seconds. Social media is also a main source of news. People who are interested in knowing the latest international and national news can do so anywhere at any time. Beside all the positive effects social media has on individuals and  society, it also has a negative impact on people. After the growth of social media, people became less in contact with their family and friends in real life; it has taken all of their time, and there are no face-to-face   interactions anymore. Another major effect of social media on kids and teenagers is  cyberbullying. With the constant use of social media for the majority of their time, teenagers are facing a lot of harmful things on the social media applications without the knowledge of their parents and family members. They are being bullied or can get in touch with some dangerous online predators. Social media has become a major part of our life. It's a source of entertainment and communication and has many beneficial uses. It has a big impact on individuals and societies, but if we use it wisely, it will not harm us and affect us negatively.
Social media affects individuals and society.  Social media has a lot of negative and some positive effects; some of them are dangerous; also, some of them can change the world and make our life easier than now.  Firstly,  we can use social media programs to share our culture and learn about other cultures, such as  traditional food and traditional dance.  Also,  with social media programs, we can talk and meet our friends easier than in the past.  Technology development has changed too many things in our life.  Secondly,  social media has a lot of negative effects if you use it more than five or six hours every day; it can damage your health, so you need to see a doctor to fix your problem,  but  if you use it less than five hours, it can help you and make your life better.  Thirdly,  social media has some  positive effects, such as  communicating with our friends and talking to them easily.   However,  you must be careful when you use social media.  In the last  period,  social media can change our life and make it better if we use it for that,  not to use it to waste our time and play on it. 
C) How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media is the most common thing these days; every single one of us has a social media app and, of course, a social media account, and every one of us has his own way of using social media apps. There are those who use social media to publish their own work, such as paintings, photographs or even writings, and this is why it exists in the first place; it's there for the people to communicate and share whatever they would like to share. There's a special kind of people on the social media who  are popular and have a lot of followers. Sometimes it's a good thing and sometimes it's not; it depends on the reason  why  this person is that popular because it's not always a good reason, and if it's not, that's a thing that we will be scared of because today, it's only a few of them, and tomorrow, it will be a common thing to see famous people being popular for the same reason. Social media has made our life easier; we can communicate with each other wherever we are in the world; we can share photos, videos or whatever we would like to share with our family, friends or even followers we don't know, which makes everything easier than  it used to be, but we should maintain our privacy, and we should keep ourselves safe, so we don't share our private photos, and we should keep everything private between us as  family or friends.
 Social media has been in our lives for  decades; every now and then, people would argue about its effects upon society itself. First and foremost, research suggests that social media had  quite an impact on technological innovation and the environmental change that founded our generation to become what it is today. Yet there are advantages and disadvantages to using social media applications; for instance, people would spend most of their valuable time  checking how many followers, likes and comments  they received today and what a famous and  well-known social media star posted or said today... etc. Secondly, people would completely fall for the idea of becoming the center of attention, and this could leave  permanent damage to such individuals who idealize other people's opinion over their own. Since most of the vast majority of people are insecure about their appearance,  personality, lack of confidence and self-esteem, this might become a bigger obstacle to manage in the near future, where they have to take responsibility and be able to decide whether it is in their favor or not, and that's how it affects individuals and society. In conclusion, I believe that people should be aware of their actions and manners when it comes to posting anything online.
 The UAE, in the past, was like an ancient castle;  the UAE today  has changed a lot in every field and sector; you cannot even relate the UAE in the past and now! Everyone can tell those amazing, insane developments! The UAE has not changed in a long period of time; it's just 47 years, and everyone knows how quickly it transformed from an empty desert to a city that no one can forget.  Every year, the UAE improves a lot of things - for instance, education, health and the medical sector - by proving the latest devices and machines for a better life and a better society; but the UAE has  two important developments at the moment in my perspective. First, in the tourism sector, they built the best luxury places for people who love the fancy lifestyles and hilarious adventurous places for thrill seekers, like the longest zipline in the world, skydiving, scuba diving and other activities; also, for those who love to relax and meditate, and literally for all types of personalities, they can have the fun and relaxation (and for a business purpose as well). Also,  the second significant development is how the UAE relates to other countries; the UAE nowadays becomes the first passport in the world due to the great tolerant relationships between it and other countries as it confirms the concept of peace, respect and fairness. This development made us better than every country as it made others competitive to be the best; that would make the world a better place; that not only changes us, but others as well. The UAE has made a lot of developments to reach a high standard no one else has reached; furthermore, it  keeps  developing. Tourism and the great relationships are ever the main factor,  and it plays a good role as you can see.
There are some people who use social media in a positive and a negative way in the society. Social media has its way to communicate with people,  socialize on the web and meet new people that can help you find jobs and even help you improve and become a better person. There is a positive effect of using social media, such as business, politics or searching for information as well as negative effects, such as cyberbullying, privacy and fake news. To start,  some people use social media in a positive way in the society, for example, opening a business to help and support others by having  low and high prices or having  advertising for the business to surround it to the world. On the other hand, some also use social media in a negative way, for instance, bullying others through social media or meeting strangers through social media, which can increase problems in the society. There are also people that pretend to be other people to get kids,  younger people and even teenagers to gain their trust and use them in a negative way. Moreover, there are people asking for personal information to make use of you by having your personal details, such as bank accounts or anything related to you, and it might be a fake website. Social media affects people in a positive and negative way in the society. However, it depends on how people use it, whether in a positive [INCOMPLETE]
Social media has its benefits, but it also can have a negative impact on society and individuals, both of which can affect your business. Social media can be used in ways that promote positive and productive ideas in society. These positive behaviors make social media an invaluable tool for young people if used correctly. Social media can be used to educate young people; it also can be used as a voice of reason in society, and it also gives teens skills to become more confident and independent. On the other hand, people who are addicted to social media may experience negative side effects, such as eye strain, lack of sleep and stress. As more people start to use social media platforms, there has been an increase in the amount of communication used through these platforms. Although there has been an increase in communication, it is not necessarily the healthiest way. Many users have become addicted to social media, resulting in more people  isolating themselves from society. With social media playing a huge role in today's society, we have lost our ability to understand emotions. If social media is  used in the right way, it will have the ability to make our lives easier and convenient. One thing which cannot be denied is that it is too difficult to abstain from social media.
Tolerance Tolerance is a very humanistic and important thing to have in a person. If everybody has this fabulous skill, we will be living in  incredible harmony and peace. Tolerance can be adopted by living and being engaged in a society that has that skill, and I think that the UAE society, in general, is a tolerant community. You can see  how the UAE welcomes all types of people and makes them live together in peace. People can live together in peace if they were tolerant and understanding. The UAE promotes the culture of tolerance by having a Tolerance Day that presents how important it is to be tolerant  almost  everywhere. One of the companies arranged a wonderful mini global village, and every country made a show that presents a thing about its culture. This activity increased the rate of people that will consider the tolerance as an important thing to have in a society, which is a wonderful way to represent this amazing facility. I think people can be tolerant easily if they were guided in  the right direction because the human learns from and adapts to its environment and surroundings, and I believe that the UAE will be one of the best societies in the world.
Development in the UAE There are a lot of developments that have been happening in the UAE since the past century, and they've been happening quickly and effectively until now to build a developed and  forward-thinking society and an open-minded mindset. Whether it's exterior-wise,  economically or politically, development, in general, would help the UAE to be modern in some ways while keeping it culturally and traditionally alive and colourful. The most important development that is happening in the UAE, in my opinion, is education; looking back at where we used to be and where we are now is overwhelming when you think of it; education has been developing since the day it was brought to the UAE; even before the union of the seven emirates, the UAE has always been setting a goal for better education for its citizens; with that, other developments have happened. Even now, the education sector is being developed to produce a  well-thinking  and forward-thinking society; also, with education comes a developed nation; with a developed nation comes more work opportunities, and with that comes better living for the person and the whole country too. Education is the important thing for everyone, and that's why I think it's the most important development that is happening in the UAE, and it's still developing to give out the best education for the citizens because without education, there won't be a country that is affective and effective at the same time. And finally, with that, I'd like to end it by saying that education is so important to me, and I'm happy that it's developing in the UAE, and it's been developed because it's important - with a developed education comes a developed country.
Social media is something people got addicted to in a short limit of time. The social media has taken over all the society, whether young or old people. Moreover, everything has its own positive and negative side. In fact, social media is a good way to communicate with all people around the world, such as family and friends. The social network also helps you to know what is happening around the world in an easy way; it's just one click, and all the information will pop up. However, the social network can also affect people in a bad way,   especially young people in this generation. As well as that, using technology can affect  your health too. It can hurt the children's eyes or back while sitting for a long time using the mobile phone, iPad or laptop. Also, let's not forget that young people's minds and thoughts are easy to change and totally different than how old people think, so it's easy for them to go through underage websites that may cause  harm to them. In my point of view, everything is fine unless people use it in the wrong way. Parents should be aware of what their children are watching.
Social media has a huge impact on our society nowadays in both ways: positive and negative. Social media has changed the world in many ways, for example,  education and communicating with others. However, few people do not like how social media changed  how they communicate because they find that communication through social media is growing their relationships with family, friends and others apart; moreover, some people are against because online communication can affect the way teenagers and some adults     speak; they are not confident enough to be outgoing and talk in person because they are used to chatting online more than talking face to face. On the other hand, it is most commonly used by teenagers; they think communicating online made life much easier and made it faster to talk. Communicating online is faster than being able to meet and easier to be friends with other nationalities and get to know others through social media.
Social media has a huge impact on people as it has taken over most of their lives. This, of course, has its effects - whether they may be positive or negative - on both the society as a whole and the individuals residing in it.        There are various ways that social media can be used for the better. It could help people raise their voices, spread awareness worldwide, reach a bigger audience and possibly change lives. There have been many cases where social media platforms were used to aid people who were unfortunate and in desperate need of help. For example, someone could be severely injured,  on the verge of death and is not financially capable of paying their medical bills - social media can gather donations and save the person's life. Some other ways of change can even be political, and different ways of participating can be as simple as signing a petition. However, there are also  horrible aspects of social media: the dark side. This includes  cyberbullying.  Cyberbullying doesn't necessarily just mean calling people names; it can also mean spreading rumors, posting unconsented images, leaking numbers, etc... People don't realize how much of an impact they can have on someone's life. They should always be kind to one another because they can never know what someone might be going through. Bullying can cause depression or even death if not handled well.
As social media spreads around the world, positive and negative actions affect different societies. Social media has become important because it made life much easier. Communication,  looking for information and finding a location are easy because of social media. It has an effect on most children and immature teenagers, but adults are safe because of the knowledge of how to use it in a safe way. Social media's safety depends on the society people live in; for example, Dubai has a station located in the police station, specifically for social media, that makes sure that people are safe from any wrong information and kids are not being lied to by unknown people; they make sure that everyone is using social media the right way, and they watch messages that come from outside of the country, like terrorists playing with teenagers' minds; they will get in touch with people to arrest the bad guys. In some other countries, people might not care about the use of social media; they say that it is useless and a waste of time. In my opinion, social media is very helpful, and it's the fastest way to communicate with people around the world; and it's very easy for the government to locate an emergency that could happen anytime around the world, and it's easy for people who have hurricanes, tornadoes and volcanoes to get an alert,  have time to evacuate their houses and get to a shelter to be safe; that's why social media has a huge part in our life.
Social media has a huge influence on our society, especially on this generation. We learn everything through social media: new ideas, new lifestyles........ The old generation did not have social media to be influenced by.  There are positive and negative things about social media. The positive thing is that you can communicate with your friends and family and see their experiences and the events they went to. Also, we can see our idols - people who influence us - daily. We can be influenced by good things, like healthy lifestyles. Social media also encourages and supports many people, like the good comments we get from others and the ability to share our experiences. Also, by having social media, you can know every day's news and what is trendy. Social media can also be negative in many ways. People can know your personal information, like where you live, or can hack your account. Also, there are many negative people on social media who will give you a bad feedback and discourage and make you feel insecure. Social media can be the very influence that leads to suicide, bad decisions, jealousy..... In conclusion, I think everyone should have social media - but not at a young age, and we should all be careful how we use it and how we influence others.
  Nowadays, social media is everywhere. If you want to know about anything such as news, what will happen in future or anything else, you can see it in social media and everywhere; just use the Internet. Social media just keeps us away from our family; we spend most of the time using social media, but it's a very good way to communicate through;  like if some of the families are outside the country,  you can communicate with them by using it, also with your friends, or anything you want,   you can reach it. Now, it's easy to get whatever  you want by using the social media; for example, if you wanted to buy some clothes, food,  etc., you just contact  whoever does these businesses, and they reach your home. Yes, social media  does affect individuals and society by people who just waste their time not doing anything, but sometimes it doesn't affect the society because by using it in a good way, it doesn't waste their time. People get addicted to social media, and sometimes it leads to suicide; we heard a lot of suicide that happens these days; that's why they should try their best to get closer to their family.
Social media is a huge part of our daily life; some of us can't live a day without checking their Instagram or Snapchat accounts, but how does it affect us and our society? If we looked back and started the difference between our small society that consists of our families,  neighbors and friends, in what aspects is this small world  different than our new urban society?  The society back there is really different; it feels and looks very true. If I could say, people didn't only recognize each other behind their phone screen;  they didn't show their feelings by liking or leaving a comment on someone's personal account; they were very connected to each other; I can say that they were a family before being a society.  There are many more different effects as well that we can see in the generation, such as the lack of confidence; kids  nowadays can't possibly communicate with other kids because of their lack of confidence, and I totally blame social media. This will totally affect the society in a very negative way.  Imagine having an employee that can send perfect emails and post marvelous shots on Instagram but can't communicate with other employees; wouldn't that be  tragic to the society?  In the other hand, social media has many positive factors for  individuals and society. You can easily expand your knowledge by following some blogs all over the Internet;  moreover, the UAE follows the smart government policy so you can easily pay your bills or ask a question, just with a click of your mouse.
In the age of developments, we have many new technologies. Social media is one of the fastest and the newest technologies that is used to share the information and to learn about other cultures; social media is used to contact friends and get new relations with new people that you haven't met before. Anything in our life has a positive and negative impact on us; for example, social media, like Twitter, Snapchat and YouTube,  all have affected our life - in a personal way - and  the society. Starting with the positive way, social media teaches us to learn new things, such as learning about other cultures and knowing about other countries. Also, social media changes our personalities in a way that lets us  do like others or  take the good things from them, but it also can be effective in a negative way, so we might get addicted to bad habits or to something against our religion. On the other hand, social media has a big impact on the society; when something new gets on, everybody talks about it, and they might buy it if it was a product. In our decade, social media makes life easier; it connects different people from all countries in a simple application. We exchange habits, news, knowledge and experts. Social media changes our life, changes our society and changes our personalities. Finally, I think that social media is one of the best new technologies that  made life easier, and it spread education. Also, it's one of the most effective media that made our life better.
Social media has been evaluated throughout the past few years. People are addicted to social media apps, which have affected them and the society in a positive way and a negative way. First of all, since social media provides people with the help to reach out to the whole globe, it actually gave us a lot of benefits, such as being able to communicate with your  long-distance relatives and friends,  finding resources for your projects, learning new skills online and becoming more knowledgeable about the other cultures that are surrounding you. However, since people are using the social media apps for a long period of time, it made them addicted to it. There are some people who don't know how to start a conversation with others face to face; some forget how much they spend using their phones, which leads to losing their  eyesight. Secondly, the fact that people are more open to the world made a difference to our society. It influenced our behaviors and beliefs, such as the concept of recycling plastic and having a healthy  lifestyle. This helped us improve and evaluate our environment, which helps our country to get better. The other good point of social media is that it helped our society and the people in it; people can find others who have the same interests as them, and it leads to developing confidence that leaves a positive effect and impacts on others. Yet the bad thing about social media is that it could affect our society in terms of tradition, culture, beliefs,   attitude and action. To sum up,  social media affects us and our society through the way we use it, either positively or negatively.
Social media Social media is like a plant; you either water it in specific amounts, and after a while, it will grow into a beautiful flower, or you water it in big amounts, which will lead to the death of the plant. Social media affects the individual and the society in a way; we decide if it is  a good way or not. Every person is responsible for the way he or she uses the social media. They can educate themself by reading news, new information, stories or anything, which will have a good impact on them. On the other side, using the social media in the wrong way could lead to wasting time or bullying others, which, in this case, will start affecting the society in a bad way. Social media affects the society in a good and a bad way. On the good side, it can spread love and friendship between the people, or, on the bad side, it can cause people to bully others, which will create a society that suffers from physiological problems. All of the individuals represent the society, and the society represents all the individuals. If the individuals used the social media for a good cause, it will build an educated generation with good manners. In the other hand, using the social media for the wrong reasons will create a generation that suffers a lack of good education and manners. It is your choice and your plant; you can turn it into a beautiful flower or let it die and be wasted.
In my opinion, I see that social media has many positive aspects. Social media affects individuals and society in many ways.  It has  positive aspects and negative ones too.  Some people agree with social media, and some of them don't;  people that don't agree with social media can see that it's without a benefit and useless, but some people use social media as it's a part of their life. Some people use social media as their work.   Nowadays, everything is on social media; you can watch the news on social media  instead of the television,  you can buy online and you can finish your work even.  As I said, there are good  and bad aspects of social media;  it depends on how the person uses it.  In my opinion,  we need social media. It has many benefits;  for example,  we can buy online instead of going out and being stuck in  traffic,  but it also has negative things, such as watching bad videos,  watching bad movies and learning bad words. Finally, it depends on how the person uses it and what he watches and learns.
Social media nowadays took a huge place in our life. It affects us in both a good and a bad way; however, it depends on how the individual uses it. Social media is a good way to know about the worldwide news and to contact with people all over the world, and that's one of the benefits we can get  from social media. In my point of view, I think that social media is an interesting thing, where I made some online friends, and they took an important place in my life, and I have to talk to them every day. On the other hand, some use social media in a bad way, such as sharing some videos and pictures, which can harm people and themselves, and that will affect in a bad way for sure. Although every problem should have a solution,  some solutions could be  to manage time on these applications and monitor people who once used them in a bad way. To conclude, everyone should agree that many people in society at least know about social media if they don't use it. It benefits more than it harms. Schools and universities use some applications for their students to help them study and contact them whenever they have some difficulties.
Social media became a trend in our modern society; it became an essential part of our lives. Individuals use social media to communicate with others, play games and much more. Social media can affect the society in a positive and negative way. It affects the society positively by transferring information online, where individuals can be informed, such as news articles. Social media also helps students in school and teachers to communicate during school hours or after school hours. People use an application called """Skype""" to communicate with their family and friends who are out of the country. Social media also affects the society negatively through  cyberbullying and games, which can lead to death. In conclusion, individuals should not use social media a lot since it can harm their eye site and harm many more things mentally and physically.
The UAE Development If people are wondering about the development that the UAE is having, then it's so huge. The UAE has seen many developments, especially in the last four years. Many things have changed in a better way, and it brings benefit to the country. The UAE worked hard the past few years to get better and better and to move forward in the world of development. Many things have been achieved in a short time  period. All of this is happening because of the hard work that people do - whether the old or the young people. Of course, the reason for this, firstly, is the help and the support that the UAE's government is giving to the people. They offer a lot of things to let people discover  theirselves and to achieve things that will help in the development of the UAE. An  example of the important development is  Burj Khalifa in Dubai, which is the tallest tower in the world.  Burj Khalifa brought many tourists to the country, just to see it. Another example is Masdar City, the city of sustainability. It brings also people to see it, which is very helpful to the country. At the end, the UAE will keep developing till it achieves what it wants to achieve and more because the UAE's people have the ability to do this. May Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan,    the leader of the country who changed it to a better place, rest in peace.
Nowadays, most people depend on their phones for day-to-day chores or activities. So with that being said, social media platforms are widely known and used every day by most phone holders. It can have various impacts on our society and on us as individuals. Plenty of people use social media platforms, such as Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. Sadly, they don't realize the damage it can cause when it is used excessively. Imagine yourself spending most of your day scrolling through your feed looking at others' lives in an imaginary and unrealistic world. That can actually cause way more harm than you would think; you are constantly having to compare yourself to everyone around you even though they only share the """good""" parts of their life. Other than that, people who use social media for long hours tend to neglect most of their tasks, so that can lead to them being unsuccessful in life because they never tried attaining their goals. Our society has gotten used to the idea of living life through a screen, so most of them don't really mind it and have accepted the fact that it may never change. As a society, we need to make a change, and it needs to happen fast. Making people around us aware of the impact social media has on us is one thing we all need to do. I think that, sooner or later, people are going to start realizing the things that are happening around them and will thrive to make a difference.
Social media is a way for people to connect to the world. They could know the news of what is happening in this world in a much quicker way as they could also get closer to people from across the world. There are many ways social media can help people change their  lifestyles to be better than their past  lifestyles. Social media can also motivate people into following their dreams. For example, a person that can cook and has many recipes might upload some of their recipes, so it might be helpful to other people, especially if they have  allergies or if they are following a diet. People can easily learn about other cultures and traditions and might connect easily with other societies. Social media also proves how individuals from all around the world could be struggling with the same issues, which could help them overcome their issues. Even though social media can benefit people, there is also a downside to it. One of the downsides is that there is  easy access to cyberbullying,   and people might misuse  their social media accounts to spread hatred between the people and cause chaos in societies. For example, people might spread rumors about a society and not portray it as it actually is, and it  causes people to start hating each other. How a person chooses to spend their time on their social media account determines how individuals feel and how they act in societies within the country they live in and all over the world.
Social media plays a big role in us nowadays; it is one of the biggest influences that no human beings are not affected by;  whether it is a good influence or a bad one,  social media has offered us a lot of useful things to do. The good things that many users use it for are that, instead of wasting money on a ticket, they would just explore social media; search for the place or the country you want to know about, and you will see an enormous amount of images, information, news and many other things. Communication is one of the best sources of social media because you get to communicate with your friends, family and even maybe your long-lost  cousins who live overseas; in addition, you get to meet people around the world online. On the other hand, there are some cons to the social media community; it can be unhealthy to use it more excessively because being addicted to anything way too much is extremely bad for your eyes, body and  mental health. Being isolated is a big problem as well, and the reason why it is not a good thing is because you spend less or no time with your family and friends in the real world. In conclusion, anything that has a good use can turn into a bad use if it is developing addiction to you. Managing your time and using social media the good way is a positive thing.
Social media is really important in this century because it is one of the best and easiest ways to keep up with our society and the whole world; but just like every other innovation, social media has its negatives and positives, and that can affect our society and us, either in a bad way or in a good way. First, I will be talking about the positives; one of the positives that I think is important is that social media helps us connect with the world and know what is going on in other countries, and another positivity is that it is a really easy way to catch up with family members who live away from us or in another country. These positives affect the individual's mental state because keeping in touch with our families is mostly our source of happiness and serenity, and if the individual is happy, they can work on improving and developing the society, while on the other side, there are the negatives; some of the negatives are that social media is  time-consuming, and a lot of people tend to waste hours and hours of their time browsing random things instead of being productive; if  many members of a society are not productive, they could stop the developing of the society and the entire country; and other than that, if they didn't do anything productive, that could lead to feeling useless, which will eventually lead to depression. I honestly think that social media is a good thing in our lives, but just like everything else, it depends on the user of it and how they use it; if you're using it in a good way, then it'll be good; and if not, then social media would be the worst thing that ever happened to you.
Social media has a great impact on the individual and society. It helped nations to communicate with others. Although social media has benefited the world, it still has its negatives and bad effects on others. So many societies benefited from social media because it helped the schools and the students in their studies, it helped researchers in their experiments, and mostly, it helped in communicating,  socializing and making new friends. Despite the positives, it also has a bad side that sometimes could put the user in danger. Nowadays, the technology became more powerful than before, and many people are taking advantage of those developments and using them in the wrong way. There are many examples of those people, like the hackers; they could hack into your devices and your social media accounts,  steal your personal information and start to threaten you. Those hackers could also pretend to be someone they aren't and mess around with kids, for example. Kids are a really easy target, so those hackers use them and take advantage of them. Now, regarding those hackers and technology thieves, they made the police departments all around the world  have  cybersecurity,  make awareness campaigns,  take those hackers down using the hackers' methods and techniques and make the hacker feel like a victim.
 Especially in the last decade, social media has started to have a huge impact on society and the daily lives of people. These impacts can be both positive and negative. An example of a positive impact is the improvement in communication. Communication as a whole became much  easier, and with the help of social media, people can now talk to each other even if they are in different countries as if they were actually face to face.  Social media has also helped with raising awareness of certain subjects around the world. For example, with the help of social media, more people are aware of issues like animal cruelty, and social media helps with giving people solutions to help aid the problem, like boycotting brands that are not cruelty-free. However, social media also has some negative impacts on individuals and society. For example, social media provided people with another platform for bullying, which, thankfully, a lot of companies are now trying to take proper measures against in order for online bullying to stop. Instagram, for example, is starting to enforce a system where comments can be censored and certain words and phrases cannot be used. This is useful as it would prevent bad comments from reaching certain individuals and therefore prevent people from suffering from certain mental illnesses, like depression, which has increasingly surfaced as a result of online bullying. Therefore, the use of social media has affected society at a large scale where a lot of its decisions are impacted by their use of these platforms, both in a positive and a negative way.
All of the people now have a smartphone  that is full of apps that connect us to the social media; it is a big world that has a positive and a negative effect because it is so huge and full of things that you can't believe   exist. People will not believe that there is a bad side of social media, so in the next paragraphs, we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of social media. Social media helped us to connect to the outside world in a different way, so we can watch and listen to  different languages from another country; we also can talk to them by translating the words to their language, and this is a very easy way to communicate with far people from the world; we can also discover other countries' cultures, so this will help us to be  open-minded and think in another way. As there are many advantages, also, there is an infinity of disadvantages; like you can connect to the world on social media; it also makes you an isolated person who loves to sit with himself always, so the communication with people around him will be less; also, you may be watching things that are above your age or things that even older people should not be watching  because they will affect them and their mind in a bad way. Some people use the social media in a way to cheat on people and do things that are bad to take money from those people, so be careful while using social media because even a small thing you see can change  many things in your personality in a bad or a good way, so take care.
Over the past 4 decades, the United Arab Emirates has extremely changed and improved in many different aspects,  making the world open its jaws in amazement and surprise. The following paragraphs are going to present the most important developments in the United Arab Emirates at the moment. No one can deny how strong the United Arab Emirates is in the tourism aspect, and that is due to having a lot of well-made architecture,  the tallest skyscrapers,  tourist attractions and also the good hospitality that comes along with the luxury hotels and the  family-friendly events all around Dubai. On the other side, the economic aspect is also one of the important reasons why people of this country are having  well-paying jobs and happiness levels are a hitting skyrocket. Because the United Arab Emirates has one of the busiest airports in the world, every three seconds, planes are taking off and landing. The United Arab Emirates also has the biggest mall in the world, which has more than a hundred different brands to satisfy every taste. The technology here is also another world; the United Arab Emirates, I believe, has its own applications, for instance, Dubai Smart Government and Ministry of Education, and there are also upcoming projects for the autonomous cars. For the transportation and the  road-system aspect, the United Arab Emirates has one of the successful road systems; it all came from  good planning and the variety of transportations, for instance, buses, metros, cars and airplanes. To conclude, the United Arab Emirates is a good example for a change for a better life and a bright future.
Social media and the effect it has on our lives Ever since the cyber world has surfaced and the Internet has become a household, most social media has started to appear in many forms. Currently, it's one of the most prominent and dominant forms of communication as it helps people connect to others from all around the world. Its easy access and simple looks made it into a billion-dollar  industry and made its creators into   the  richest people on Earth. The 21st century has been named the technological era because of how we changed and transformed simple things into mechanical beasts; one of the main things that have been affected heavily is the communications sector as it turned from being a  slow-moving expensive act into the exact opposite; but like everything that develops, it starts to form some negative effects. Social media has become such a toxic platform for many people as lots of negativity has begun to be released from it. The biggest way it has affected our lives is by turning people into loners; teens nowadays are stuffed in their rooms with their eyes glued to screens, and they're either scrolling through Instagram or watching videos on YouTube; it has made lots of teens have social problems as they start to distance themselves from life outside their four walls. You can witness this effect by watching them present at school; some have lost all their confidence in speaking in front of their peers as they have gotten used to communicating with them over text. Another way it has affected our lives is by making standards for many things, like weight, looks and even items. This has made users become more self-conscious and made them work harder to change who and what they are just to be able to fit in; but on the other hand, it had many positive effects on us as it made the road to learning other cultures and meeting new people easier and cheaper as access to social media has become free and simple; with one click, you can make a profile and start chatting with either new people or old friends you're dying to connect with. In my opinion, the positive effects of social media outweigh the negative effects by a lot; if you surround yourself with the correct people and access beneficial programs, you will rarely come across all the negativity.
Social media affects individuals and  society in several ways, both positively and negatively. It all depends on an individual's way of using it; some might use it to start a business, just for fun or even to become an influencer. The way you connect and communicate with others through social media has an effect on you and the people around you. When one starts a career as an influencer, they choose the path in which they would affect the society and the audience viewing the content. Projecting appropriate content to the audience's age group with specific interests might positively inspire them to do good; however, creating inappropriate content and views would negatively influence them. For example, young children who follow makeup bloggers would mostly be influenced by them to apply makeup at a young age; in that case, bloggers should be aware of their audience's age group. All social media users have different interests, yet most users follow similar accounts for different reasons; some might like the content or the person behind it or just because it's trending. Social media apps should have a system for followers; once you start an account, you can answer a few questions, which would then make a list with all people who might interest you and present content appropriate for your age group. To conclude, your intentions and way of using social media reflect on how it's going to affect you and the society.
Social media is where you can chat and share videos or something else on some applications, like Instagram, Snapchat, WhatsApp and many more. Some people use social media to chat with family, so they do not have to meet each other; this can affect their relationship, and they may  not see each other for a long period of time. Today, people are sharing their lives on their social media accounts,   and some  famous people are doing this as a source of getting money, where they have to download a vlog on YouTube and share all of the events that happen to them. Moreover, these types of vlogs can attract children to do the same thing, and there will be no privacy; everyone's life is on social media, especially children who will not  focus on other stuff; they will only get busy with social media. On another hand, most of the TV shows are advertising for their social media accounts to get more followers and viewers. For example, if they have  important news,  they will say to people, """Wait" for us on Instagram at 8:30 AM; we will share the news "there,""" so this idea makes everyone  have an Instagram account,  start to use it well and have more knowledge about it. To conclude, social media can affect you if you are using it in a bad way; try not to  let it be the most important thing in your life.
Social media is a way that people use to contact with family, friends and others. Social media affects individuals and society through positivity and negativity.

How does social media affect individuals and society? """Don't" say anything online that you wouldn't want plastered on a billboard with your face on "it.""" - Erin Bury. There are pros and cons to social media;  in today's age, social media is the most used thing;  since our lives depend on the Internet so much, you can literally find anything and everything on social media. However, social media, in general, has some pros and cons; examples of the cons are: social media posts cannot be entirely deleted, so if your information falls into the wrong hands, that can be the end of you;  criminals can use social media to commit and promote crimes; and let's talk about the pros.  Messaging on social media sites can lead to face-to-face interactions; when plans are made via the site, or when you have a loved one who's abroad, you can always skype them,  and last but not least, and personally my favorite, is ordering food online; I receive my food while I'm in my sweatpants and  oversized t-shirt watching Netflix, so at the end, I'm with and not against social media, but you have to use it in a good way and make sure you don't let others harm you, or you don't harm others in any way.
The 21st century has lots of developments, such as architecture, technology and health fields; these are the most important developments in the UAE nowadays. The most important one is technology developments, which improve our industry in the UAE, and we use technology a lot in our life, for example, in schools, universities and hospitals. The technology became a part of our lives we can't live without. Technology makes our life much  easier than before because everything we need is available in  smartphones, smart cars and even  smart homes, which helps us a lot. On the other hand, we have the architecture and how it developed over the years by building something unique and beautiful and symbolizing something. However, the UAE has the amazing buildings because of new building materials and, of course, by using technology. Furthermore, health fields have recognizable improvements in treatments and surgery. In the soon future, there will be robots in surgery rooms to help doctors and do a surgery instead of humans. Living in the center of technology makes our lives easy.
Social media effects are all over the world; people use social media to communicate with their friends and family. They find it a faster and easier way to talk to them, but have you ever wondered what  the effects of social media are? People like trying new things, and when a new way of communication was discovered and invented, everyone wanted to try it and use it. Accounts from different countries and different continents were made, and people started making friends they never would have met if it weren't for social media. These friendships help the individuals in learning more about foreign countries and their cultures and traditions. Moreover, making connections with people who have different experiences and opportunities broadens their minds and gives these individuals new perspectives on life. Furthermore, connecting people from a variety of different countries helps in connecting societies and communities. Having a view of how other communities live their lives makes people in each society want to improve themselves and therefore results in a developed society. Additionally, when people look at how other countries are developed and how it affects their life, that motivates them to work harder towards making their society better. So having social media helps societies develop, and it can change the way people in each society think. To sum up, social media has huge effects on both the individuals and the society. It can connect people from different countries and create new connections in societies. It's also considered a factor in the development of some societies and countries.
I am gonna talk about how  social media affects individuals and society. Social media can affect the UAE in so many different ways. The first thing will probably be social media, like  Snapchat or Twitter, which is corrupting the UAE in so many different ways; they can communicate with people they already know and people they don't know anything about,    which can sometimes be wrong for the person individually. The other way social media can affect the society is how people use their phones everywhere and for everything that they are doing, which makes it even harder to actually communicate with other people in real life since they are always using their phones to communicate with the person who is in front of them. For example, how  social media affects me individually is how I am always using my phone even if I'm sitting with my family, which is wrong because I don't always know what is going on with my family and how their day was. How does social media affect the society? For example, when I'm sitting in a waiting area or sitting with friends, all the people who are around me are on their phones, and when I try to have a conversation, they are not listening because their eyes are connected to their phones, and they are not concentrating on anyone around them. What I'm trying to say by all of this is that people, and so do I, have to put our phones or any type of technology down for some time, which would help us individually and the society.
  Nowadays, most  people around the world are on social media more than their real life,  but everything  has its advantages and disadvantages for the person  themself and for the society. Social media makes our life easier and moves it faster; it makes our work  done in the fastest way, without waiting for someone to do it; just with one link or app, you can do many things, such as shopping online for everything:  clothes, grocery, paying online for shops or  renewing your cards, just with an app and putting your information, and you're done, without waiting  online and waiting for the place to open at its work time; social media makes these things easy for the society. A good side of it is that if you have any problem with anything, you can see different people view  it, so it helps even with making things; just search and you will find the steps to follow and do.   Everything has its good sides and bad sides, so social media has bad sides  for us as individuals and as a society; like you might be tracked to a spam shopping,  you pay online and your payment information is online on the cloud, or your accounts get hacked by a hacker, and all your information is in danger because it will be with a strange person who is a hacker!! This is for me as an individual, but it can affect the society too; like if an online government bank gets hacked, all the bank's customers' information will be lost, but don't worry, these places have a huge secure system, and they update it every time, so it is a system that can't be broken by anything.  Away from hacking, social media has taken our time - we can't focus on time - or made us lose the time; you might slip an important appointment, just because you were busy with the social media stuff and could not focus on the time while it was passing, so don't let the social media  control you, and you control it  the way you want.
Tolerance is an important skill we should know and learn; it helps us to be more careful with and knowledgeable about others. However, our community is facing a fact that tolerance can be applied only for a certain time as we are in the year of tolerance here in the UAE. Moreover, in the UAE, tolerance is so important for the society; our rulers decided that this year, 2019, is the year of tolerance. This year in the UAE, we made a lot of talking circles and advising sessions to let people in the UAE know how much important it is; we started promoting more about this subject in schools, offices and also in the tourist places. H. H. Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may he rest in peace, told us that tolerance is not just for us to know what it is; however, it is also for the society and how we deal with others, either in our country or with the foreigners. We should show them how respectful we are; we should work on ourselves and be achievers. In conclusion, tolerance is a fact that we should follow in our life always, either in our community or with others abroad.
