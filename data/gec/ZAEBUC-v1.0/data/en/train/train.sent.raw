Developements in the UAE Located in the middle east, a very calm yet geographic country known as the United Arab Emirates. The UAE has a desert climate in which its sometimes pleasantly cold when it is winter time and the weather gets really hot when it is summer, it is sometimes sunny and sometimes humid. Nearby countries make the heat unbearable according to their weather. Rains make the citizens of the UAE happy becuse it is rare to rain after a hot season. However, rain comes in the form of showers or/and downpours. The UAE promotes happiness in which the government's goal is to spread positivity and joy in within the citizens and that is done by non-profited organizations. People wake up early in the morning,  get ready to go to work, school  university, or even to drop their child off somewhere. Recently, the announcements in the UAE have been aiming to highlight the country as a global capital for tolerance due to what their greatest ruler known as Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nehayan  and  was the UAE's first president  prefers and wants, in which people should create peace and love upon  eachother. Spreading happiness is also a big goal and aim in the country.
in the past few days i noticed that there is something wrong with people the social media has effected so many people. There are advantages and disadvantages some of them are good and some of them are bad.For  example we can learn  alot of things from social media it could help us to build our mind by a lot of informations.Also,it   will help us  alot in the future.There  are some bad effects as well it could be dangearos for our health.Espicly  now in this devolpment socity it also may effict our eyes and mind as well beacuse we put our effort in it and sometimes we social media make people counfused and they dont trust their self they only trust the social media.Social  madia effects childrens the most beacuse they keep playing games that will rain their minds and theyll be attected,and  taking to strangers is the most dangreous thing that the kids will do they are still young they beleive things so easliy.In  genral the social media can effect many people young or old....
Social media in this genration is very bad, all  people want to be famous in the social media, some people  famous in a good way but some people are  reverse. Social media is affect  alot about the people  the society because its effecting them by making people more more busy by their phones and the dont foucs on their lives anymore and they foucs own ather things and that effect students to , they will be always on their phones as if they dont have to study and they dont care about their studies , and beople are bulling peple using social media that effect the phys 
nowadays.In uae  coutry have many truble with social media arroud the cammunity anywhere in  places.However,social  media is  huge group of technology which is control the network,but  it is danger for our mind and health.Also  it can affect our children by using phone, video game and computer. To begin with, social media is  large group of society who  can people work  with.Unfortunately  is not good for children over 12 using moblie maybe it well damage there mind and   lose there life what like other children.Parent  should rather there children use there own social media , becaues they well met new stranger in there facebook ,twitter and  snapchat.Moreover,they  will lose there society  also there life too.been  in society which is  group of people most of  young people who usuasly use social media they are not using  for real or for neccessary or  any subject only they take  for fun and for who comome with.unless     goverment should banned some social media for  next generaste because of theses issue.
C;How do social media affect individauls and society? Nowadays,almost  people have telephones and can use  internet By using social media,we  can interact with others and find information about everythings. However,despite  these sceptical views,some  opponents believe that social media makes people robotic and make  become nerds. In the  past,people would contact with others face to face or wrote volumes of letters.But  now people use instagram or facebook and just text some emojis with staring down  their phones.This  could be said  people become sticks and unnatural. whereas,in  my opinion,although  there are some drawbacks in social media,it is  brought forth good fruites on society.Consider  about comfortable about get many information in  social  media,including but not limited  different culture,news,politics,travel    information etc...its  connect with all.I  cannot imagine my life without phones. Society will develop forever and then we should use that technology.Do  not  confined in old thoughts,and  do not abandon new ideas.
Social media has  alot of effects in the world , It's effect in good and bad way . Social media effect individuals and society. I will talk about how social media effect the individuals in both way. There  is alot of things  that Social media can effect people in  bad way . some of this things  is : They use social media 24 hours per day without doing anything else , also they eat  alot. Maybe the social media effect their health too; because when people use social media they don't want to go out or walk or do some exercise they just want to set on the mobile phone and eat all the day. So that  wrong for their body and health. In the good way: social media could let people have a new freinds from another countres. Also  could let people contact with their teachers in the university if they have some important questions. People can learn new things from social media they don't know it before. How  social media effect the society. Social media could do some big problems to the society like it's mybe be a big fight with to countres because  some wrong things that happens in the social media. The good things that social media could gives to the society is the development and evolution and urbanism. Social media is so good but you must use it in the good way. it's will help you and the society  alot but you must use it in  good way and do some good things on it.
Tody, there are many new things  affect to owr society for example, the social media. There are many social media programs : twitter, whatsapp, facebook , instagram and snapchat. Those are the more popular programs in the UAE. people can contact easly and share many informations in social media, and that affect to the person and society. Famelies need to be more carefull for ther children if they used this programs because there are many risk people they will talk with thim, also this programs are not alloweded for childrens ander 13. Another thing is some people spend a long time in these media and that will affect negatively to there helth. social media also affect to our society because there are  alot of bad people they want to destroy the society. Its also will affect to the works because people spend a lot of time in the social midea and didnt done their job.
With the UAE announcing the year 2019 as the year of tolerance, many inetatives were launched to promote it among the socity. but nothing can come before the historical visit of the Pope of vatican, in the begining of the year to the UAE, and the meetings he held with the leaders of the UAE, and the agreement he saigned with the Grand Imam of Alazhar as a representitive of the muslims world, and of course the mass he held at the largest sport veneu in the UAE, Zayed sports city. This visit have opend a huge door for people to learn more about there partners in the world from another relegions, and created a new wave of joint efforts from  muslims,christians, and jwish to to work on the similarity between them, instead of emphesising the differencs. From my point of view the UAE by this visit took a huge step in promoting a culture of tolerance, and made a legacy that made not only the locals but everone in the UAE proud of it, and this pride to  keep has to be presented by empleminting the wells of the brothering humntrian meeting and reflects it on the socity and between its people.

Nowadays, social media is so popular and important to everyone weather they were kids or adults. In each emirati house there is at least one person who`s in social media. So, for sure there are some effects that social media did to individuals and the whole society. At first let me explaine how do social media affect individuals and society by several boints. First of all, social media made it easier for people to connect with thair families and friends, so that made a social gap in our society. becouse of the easy connection, people now dont visit their families and friends like before. The second effect is that kids now are useing cocial media too which is bad for them becouse in social media there are so much bad things that kids should not watch. In addition, when little kids are useing social media they would not play outside and be active and act like normal kids which make them lazy and fat. Also these days social media helped and played a big role in spreading rumors and fules news and this can be very dangeruose for the government and the whole society so  noone should belive everything in social midia.
I think that the most important thing's that the uae has done a huge developments in it's society and it's culture,Which  made the UAE from the world lowest Econmey to the highest of them all.They  have started to get stronger by all ways that they made everything equal in every ministry which is something hard to achive these days in other countrys,Our  passport now is the highest ranked passport between all country's of the world and thats thank to the ministry of the affairs,The  goverment had proved to all country's in the world that they can achive anything and do anything if they do the right choice which is something good for the country and good for the people whos  living on   there land's.There are some huge developments that the UAE has done between these year's  from the day they united togther till the day we are on right now,  which is hard to forget all the hard work that the goverment has done to us.We  have all kind of ministrys in the UAE which there are the good one and there are the ones that  not doing well but,The  day will come for all of the minstrys that they will work hard and achive what the country wants.
Many people these days use the social media to be in tuch with their friends and to know about what happend in the world. Now adays, people can find jobs also by searching in the companys post on social media. social media can affect the people in good and bad way.The  benefit of use social media is that people can be aware of what happens in the world and the latest news. Also,many  people brefear to read the news online rether than  pabers. that can help save the world from west more papers . however, social media leads people to spend most of there time away from each other in real. many people hwo use the social media a lot spends less time with there familys. that can let the parents no take a bad idea about social media. in my opinion, i think social media is good if we use it in good things and never forget our  life,family and our jobs.
In the UAE their are improveing a lot. For example, now their are making some robbotics and it is changing a lot in the UAE all sow in Fujairah they are make the place better and nicer to go to it and thee UAE it makes more improving for the people from out side the country to come and visit it. Nowdays, the government school are improving to concentrate more in English and in all the subjects all sow they are improving the hospite and all sow their trying to band the plastic because  they are westing the environment in the UAE.
How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media nowadays is playing a big role in society. It can affect the people in good ways and bad ways. Social media has been around for years but it has been developed where new sites and new apps are being put out there for the people. Social media is a source where people can communicate, post about their daily lives, make money out of promotions and many more. People can create content and make a platform using social media which can make people big and for that they can get paid. The problem with social media is that there is a dark side of it where people can get bullied, exposed, blackmailed and so on. The bright side of social media is where people create their own platform where they can get paid for sponsorships or getting paid for creative content or sell merchandise or selling their products , people who make these type of content are called influencers. These influencers can fall in many categories such as beauty influencer, lifestyle influencer, bloggers and many more. Influencers make content to teach, suggest,  talk about anything in life that can benefit their followers. Social media in my opinion is a really great way to communicate,  take pictures and videos to share to your snapchat or instagram story, and really everything is great about it but, people or society needs to be careful because whatever's on the internet stays on the internet.
How does social media affect individuals in society? In the world we live in today, social media is a very significant part of our lives. We use social media all the time for just about everything including contacting friends, family, business partners and so on. We also use it to update our followers with what we are doing currently on our """stories""" on Instagram and Snapchat. It makes our lives so much easier than if we didn't have social media. It is something most of us use daily  sometimes not because we need to but because we want to. But just like anything else social media can be used in a good or bad way, in this day and age many people use it to slander, harass, or even threaten other people and this can and has already caused a lot of problems. I do not condone such acts, but in my opinion this was bound to happen with or without social media. This is a huge step in our world and I cannot tell where social media is going, but I am sure that it will always be  apart of our lives no matter what.

Families nowadays have distance between them and there child so they have to give some time and stay with them because this thing really affect on family issues. Moreover, some use it in a way to save photos and ask for money so or theyll post it and everyone  sees  it.This proplem has face many parents, so what  would I like  say is that dont stop youre kid from  it but at least put some time and sit together beacuse it help them whem theyll grow and as we know that thses days social media  took all out time and we cant manage our daily routine I hope that we can get rid of all  this and try to manage time and keep time and stay with our family.

A social media could pretty sure harm on individuals and society. Each person now had a social media in their smart phone. In my opinion, using social media most of the time than usually will affect on our health. If we did not have aware for the disadvantages of using social media we obvisely will lost our good health. For instance, we might have a hurt back and less sight. There are so many causes if we don't use social media in the right way. That means we need to foucs and use it if we have a necceary situation or using it for  short time. When parents sitting all the time on their phones on social media without communication with their family member the other ones will have a same habit of wasting their time using those harmful social media. I think the government must teach the society how that will let them be so apart with their life. Children also might use the social media  more hours than the adults people. This might let children to stop studying well. And thats will affect in their grades, because they will were have  addiction of using social media so much in their daily life. Also some people can be sensitive if they saw someone bully them in front of all people. That might let them feel bad about themselevs and thinking about that all the time and they will not have a positive energy. So people need to improve themselevs, have aware and stay away from those harmful social media.
The social media has a big effect  individuals and society. There are a positive effect and nigitive effect. The positive effect  that we can learn many things from the social media such as fashion, health, decorate and some good ideas. We can learn from the fashion. they show as the new shops and where we can buy the dress from and how to wear a nice clothes in the perfect place. For example, in the weeding we should wear a pretty dress from the place that they told as where. There are many doctors in the social   give as many advices to learn it with out visiting the doctor. Such as  gym, diet, exirsices and other disses. In social media any body can easlly know how to decorate their room or house. There are a lot of nigitive effect from the social media. First of all, the childrens play all the time on the phone and they don't focus on study. secondly there is some people in the social media  say bad words and they have a lot of followers. thirdly now a days people set alone all the time bacause of the social media, they don't visit each other.
Last years  UAE start to build many of buildings such as companies, hotels, hospitals, and schools.  UAE is working to develop our country more and more to be the highest in the future.

Khalifa tower gathers a lot of people also there where a lot of celebritys who visited dubai famous tower also the view made a lot of people be intrested to come and see it on real life. The UAE is still developing every year they come up with new ideas to make our country bigger and better. And one of the most important develops is  kalifa tower which made dubai the way it is today.
1- I think the most imprtant development in the UAE it is the education  changed  alot. For example , they focse more about the studay .

Also  UAE try to effect on people to study to be educated , UAE do  alot for the commenty to be confortabl and to make everthing to developements  contry , also . people wen see the contry care about them this it the commenty wel be confortabl about everything .

Also, it will affects individuals because in social media there is bad stories that it will affects individulas and   doing the same bad things they saw it in  movies or  stories. However, there is postive things that help individulas and society on social media. For example, social media is imprtant for asking about something  help us for studying or something like that also it's good to chatting with another country and teach from them the languagge  also makes happy relationships with others. Also, it's easy to do anything at social media without going any place  just as where you are and that's is some bad and good things about social media and how  affects individuals and society.

 UAE is one of the most development conutry and it trying to be the best in too many way.for  example in aducation it has a lot of schools and colloge with too many techers to help the students in a dieffernts subjects .also in the madicte its trying to have a good and  best madecane  for their citizens .But the most important developments in our conutry I think  technology because its makes  UAE more faster in communiction and transportaion .For example the peaple dont have to hire a car to go to their work or pay for the bus transportation they just can work in their laptop or their computer . Also   the citizen student s its hlep them in their classes  might be hard for them to go for study in colloge so they the can take their classes online . so  think this  a most important at this moments
Today, social media is very important to us. Social media have many apps that we use to talk to each other that can affect the person and the society in many ways.The  person can prefer to stay alone and use this apps all the day which waste the time,it  makes the person lazy to do the work. Also,it  affect the mental health  that you lose focus  and it brings the back pain and eyes problems. However,you  can express your feelings by writing about it and share it with others,you  can share the best moments with your friends and you can comunicate easily in any time.on  the other hand,the  social media increase the discriminate between the people specially the teenagers that makes them hate each other, they lose friends and they feel not intrested on others. The positive side is that you can have friends from different places which develop the relationships between the countries,you  can find out many informations about what is going on around the world and you can do your own trade to other places on the world.Social  media can be good or bad it depends in how you use it. In my opinion , social media is a very good way to develop the person and the society.

These days social media play an important role in our society .So, some people think that its useful .While others believe that its effect our lives badly. This essay will discuss both sides and will draw my personal conclusion . In one hand , social media have a very important advantages its make you close to the outside world .For example , if you are study aboard you can know whats happen in your country and also you can comunicate with your family or frrends .Secondly , if you want to search for a information you will take it easir and quicly without going to professors becuse its take to long time , the professors they will  be not availble everytime  for you . On the other hand , social media can effect your lives badly .For example , if you sit to long in  it may effict your health also when you useing it you didnt know everyone you should pat attention to them becuse their  is alot of pepole  violate your privacy . To sum up , after a carful analysis of both point  views , i belive that social media its important in our lives becaues its make our lives esiar in every thing communication or study so that what makes it important.

On the other hand, the social media  helpful for some people such as they can open  new business. In my opinoin social meida is bad for our society,because  its affects badly to our society.

Bad thing and wrong thing its mean the news that people writed on them self and it not a true news.

How does soial media affect individuals and society ? The affect of social media in society is the conturbution of """us""" as a society accessing the world wide web. Social media has taken over a current generation through Twitter Facebook or even instagram it has become as a race  who can """post"""  """tweet""" the lastest fashion,  news or even the lastest rumor reports. But how does all these social media trends affect society and societies, the social media has a postive and negative affects just like any other thing that has been created and introduced to humans it just relays on the purpose of the use. The postive affect of socila media in my own modest opnion is that the social media helps a whole planat interact through the outlets it offers, it can lead humans to understand and respect each other tradtions as well as culture. The negatives of social media can be deasastress as it can spread dangerous biest racial ideas opnions and idiolgy through its outlets, as a result it can start a racial war within the isnide of a country. The social media can inspire an indivual intoo to becoming a postive or a negative change in a society depending on the use of its sometimes sentive attractions.
Most people think that social media doesn't have any negative sides . But it have more negative side than benefits , one of the affects is that it can serve as a platform for inappropriate actions. people might do or say things they wouldn't in real life because they are minimal rules for communication in social media. Another affect  that personal data and privacy can easily be hacked and shared on the Internet . which can make financial losses and loss to personal life . Similarly, identity theft is another issue that can give financial losses to anyone by hacking their personal accounts. also addiction can be one of the affects of social media and its a very bad and dangerous that someone be addicted to social media and its can disturb personal lives as well. The teenagers are the most affected by the addiction of social media because they don't have any idea that social media can make them addicted to these applications , nowadays   our kids or children they most have phones and this thing lead them to be addicted and also as we have nowadays online games it have the same affect of social media because they can chat with people they dont know and its too bad to be hacked or addict to social medi
Nowadays, the important thing that the coutries want is to have a development country.  UAE is one of these countries that develop everyday.  It  ranked as the most popular coutry around the world becouse of the developments that they own. In this essay I will discuss about the most important developments in the UAE at this time, and my opinion about it. There  is alot of developments in the UAE, but the most important development that effect the country in a positive way is having a technology in the first place. For instance, using the technology for studing. As a result, the students will learn in several ways by using technology. On the other hand, it also have bad effects in children becouse they are using it to play all the time instead of learning new helpful things that might help them in the future. Generally speaking, technology is the most important developments in the UAE thesedays.  And it also has positive and negitive effects. It seems to me that all the developments that happend recently in the UAE is important, but the technology might be on of the important developments, and I believe that everyday  the UAE is coming with something new that will let the country  in the first place now and in the future.
Social media can affect a people in many ways both negativley and positivley. To most people openining social meidia is a daily habit ,some people even open it on a hourly basis. While for myself i used to open social media every couple of minutes now i just don't seem to care about it as much as i used to. About some of the positive things i mentioned about social media earlier it is like you can stay in contact with the world and see whats happening in the world like for example knowing what movie or series or album just got release or knowing the news , another major positive point about social media is that some apps like instagram , pintrest ,etc. give artists, authors and comidians a platform to perform on and it can aslo give normal people like you and I a place to express how we feel and to see the world from a diffrent prespective   , you can 1 min see football knew like what player joind what club and another moment  see a timelaps of a street artist drawing. While I do have  alot of things to say about social media not all are positive there is a negative side to social media like it builds a bad habbit and  sort of a addiction in us.We  as humans feel the need to know what our friends are eating, where  are they going and what  are they doning and that is when in my oppinion i feel like it is too much , its nice to know stuff but you dont have to know everything all the time.when  you post  alot on social media and  alot of poeple view it its like you dont have privacy anymore because everything sees everything you do.

Social media effect the society.social  media now effect the family.that   mean,before every one should talking and we should going to see the family,but  now no body  talking everyone  at social media in sum up, we should have a plan to orgnization or time.in  my opinion, the family should see our child
social media does affect our society in many ways. there are must to be an advantage and  disadvantage in every thing, social media have many ways to affect you in a good way or a bad way one of the most popular opinion that everyone knows  that social media became an important thing to communticate with each other and to know the news in addition to this social media affect our life in many ways on of them is that we waste a lot of time sitting on our laptop. on the other hand, there are many advantage for using social media   that we can communicate with the others faster and you can save time like on online shopping to finish what you want without going outside the home and be worry about being so tired of going outside for hours. social media can not effect you if you are using it right and making time for it. social media must effect your kid so easily hence i suggest that you look for your kid very much. there are many mistakes that we made on social media like many people put their own information on there account and we can figure out their location and that will cost maybe a life so we should be so careful about  thing we but it online. there are a lot of accounts that has been hacking so people should be responsible to update their password or you can download an application that called antivirose.
People affects in a lot of thing faster and the big example is the phone and social media. Lets took about how social media affect the person individuals, social media is another and  huge word for it and some time it kill people whereas its not a person. there is a story about a boy that he kill hem self becouse of the baling at school, he is a normal boy and in some day he login  to twitter and he see a lot of people lafing on hem. Social media makes people think that every thing is many and they make the cheldren more angry and selfish. However, social media not just affected individuals its also affect the society. In this case all the people and the word begin to be more agerseve. If the govermnt or the reponsebal people dont solve the problem now, I think and I now that the word will be  desaster. Thay should to feger the problem and work on it as poseble  they can. Its just need some time so people now that they incorege and beleive in a rang  people or  rang  selepretes , but not all of them are the same some of them are very good
i think that social media has a huge impact on all people aroud the world generally, it has effected people  from alot of ways  mentally,physically and ect... in my opinion, social media has effected the people in a bad way and it became the most powerfull things that you cant stop,It  became so addictive that that some things could  be not true and people still believe  it.and it can effect  alot of people mentally and physically for example, peoplw commited suaside and kill themselfs just by  some stupid comments and  alot of people  no future or no hope and lost there drweams becuase of it . these thing   happening for a while now and people  can't still leave it because it is as I said is a huge part of out life and it will never go away.so  as the social media effected the individuals it has effected the society to be making it become more lazy and lost and have no achivement and goals. it made them focus on the people who lost their lives not on making the world a better place and making it go forward. also it is the main thing that is making the tension and argeument between families and friends. but in the end i hope that the social media becomes more helpfull and more of a resting place to make people work hard and achive more in the future.
As we know now a days no one can live without social media , social media now is mean everythig to us we can't do anything without social media even also social media was a bussiness for the famous peolpe In addition  social media become a lot of people  famouse even if they do nothing in ther account only they post they daily rutine  they become famouse. But we must know that ther are advantages and disadvantages for social media and it depend  how the people use the social media if they use it in  wrong way it will affect them in  bad way and it will affect the society as will. May be there  is who don't know more about the social media and they start to use social media but in  bad way the question is why  they start to use social media in  bad way ? is because no one tell them the correct way in how to use social media so they don't have much information on how to use social media. so I prefere that  always must be the person who always tell the people how to use the social media in  correct way so there will be no social media problems in the community.

I believe that social media is a sword with two sharp ends. If you use it correctly and mindfully you will decrease those bad effects, but for our case here and our society and for my views on this topic, I believe that social media took a really big bad toll on us as a society and as individuals. Thats why I would like to focus on the bad aspects of social media and its effects. First of all, social media has zoned-out  teenagers from their surroundings, and you can see that when thier on the phone and somebedy trys to talk to them, it has dropped down all or most of the actual or physical sociall interactions with normal human beings sitting beside them to an extent where it becomes weird if no one stares at their phones. Secondly, its become more of a hazard while driving, so it can now kill you instead of just having bad effects. Thirdly, there are many studies that show that there are bad phsycological effects on handing youngsters phones and social media accounts at such a young age. At the end, I believe that a supportive and careful family must overlook or supervise all social media activity to decrease or weaken those bad effects on our future generations.
 UAE is the place of the life , peace and culture .

UAE will be always the best country to start a new life on it.
the social media is one of the most affecting things in theis days . social media have changed our world in a huge way, some of the people in theis days from diffrent ages and diffrent nationalties use social  as a job or a way of living. social media has opend a hole  new opprtunties for most of the people. maybe you cant succses in your studies, but you can succses in providing a nice contact for the viewrs. social media is affecting all the people in multi ways. you can see the news or football games or funny videos or any thing you would like to watch. social media is controling a lot of things in theis days. in the past reaching other persones from other countries wasnt easy, but now you can do it in a few seconds with just pressing one button. most of the people theis days belaves the social media more than what happens in front of their sight. most of the news that people publish are rumors. social media have postive sides and negative sides, for that it could harm some people and it could be usefull to others . from my point if view not all ages can use the social media freely , all of the kids should use the social media with  parents watching.

Social media is the most important for people to be on toched with there familys, friends and others. children is using  much more than the older people and have more ideas to make somthing new. The problems of the social media is not using it propobly for example playing online,  haking other computers and phones. In owr country the police have make a social media policy, so if someone hacked your account or your laptop they can find who was the hacker  and take the hacker to the court. Socal media is much eaiser than  the past, you can send your presntations,  photos. The people is inventing new application and study it well before they poblish it to the world. For examble the Scanner is an application  could scan the paper with the camera and atomatically changes  to PDF so this is much eaiser than getting a copy with the printer. The people have to use the internet propably and get their work done, in Emirates  have been some problem with an application named Snapchat, some of the users have not  using it the propale way becuase
The social media have  alot of affect and good thing in the people , in the past they did't use social media then now becous the have a lot of app to use and ther is to much people  are famous and have a fun   .see the new news on the intrnet , people they addictn  the social media every thing come in one screen ,their  is aolt if effect first in  eyes the society should reed and writting and read a book go away from the phone , people  have fun sure to do something in the phone.
I think the most important development in the UAE is technology , beacuse it is the most thing that  help you to connect with the others where ever they are in the current time . Also we can see how our demenstries focus in this part , they try to make every thing includes technology .Such as, education . on  other hand , using technology make every thing easier for example you can cantact with anyone quickly also you can know the news of  worlds using your cellphones .Currently , our country spiacally our precdent , for example HH shaik mohammed bin rashid he is trying to develop every demnistry by using the technology to make life easier for us . so this kind of development can make the country or sociaty  in high level of develop . me as a student I can talk espaically in aducation and how the technology help us to study , it help us to contact with our teachers and make the relation between us better.
Today, i will discuss a problem  how do social media affect individuals and society, some people expected it's a small problem but it's not. First, the social media published a new bad culture for the country. Socandly,  will be diffculty for young people to deal with old people becouse of  lack of communication with them. Thirdly, one of the social media affect is that it preoccupies young people from studying he will get a lot of time for play or speking with his friends at social media and maybe he likes dating on social media. There are some people who expect communication sites to be useful in some ways,  one ways is to get many friend in many countrys. on the other hand, he may meet bad people and learn bad habits. In my opinion, social media has big problems for people and cildren in
First of all, social media affect individuals and society positively and negatively. It depends on the individual or the society to decide to which side their affect will be on. The actions, ideas and behaviours determine the affect of the social media, for example, some socities function in social media to share some reading stuff, fundraisers and sport events. For individuals, they can share their own thoughts but without hate or invading other people privacy. Individuals might represent their own societies or countries so they have to follow the pervious examples and go way better to show the positive affect of social media. Second, the negative affect of social media could be shown in many ways. As mentioned perviously, it depends on the individual and the society actions, ideas and behaviours to limit the affect. For instance, black mailing is one of the mostt commited crimes via social media, these crimes commited by ones who think bad of social media and want to share hate between people in social media. Some individuals use social media applications to distribute false news, for example a reporter is looking to get paid extra money by spreading rumors in social media and some other reporters do the same just to get more attention. In conclusion, social media could have both affect positive and negavtive. people who are using or functioning in social media can decide whether they are going to get the good affect or the bad one.
social media is the most popular way to connect with other people these days , becuase of the enternet and the new smart phones wich is everyone and every house got  atleast one smart phone . The social media has two sides like every other thing in the world a good side and a bad side ,the good side is  social media made our life easier to communicate with other family members and friends and also to make new friends through some apps online ,and sometimes you can learn from other people thiere experinces and mistakes so you can avoide them and carry on .On the other side, the social media can be a danguros weapon if you didn't used it correctly like if you put your personal information or pictures ,that will be easier for hackers to take your credit card or your home address .Some people use the social media a lot and stay late at night and be late to work or sometimes never show becuase he didn't sleep at night and that is one of many bad things when you use the social media in a bad way ,and few of them becuase of the social media they don't like to meet others and just connect with them through the enternet .
What do you think are the most important developments in the UAE at the moment ? in my opinion there is many important developments in the UAE  more importnant  that expo 2020 is coming soon and one of the most importnat development is khalifa SAT it's the first satalite created and launched in the UAE it was created  with finest mind around the UAE . and there are some other developments which are interseted and one of the developments is """BERWAZ" "DUBAI""" it has the most interseting inovations and technology it's located in between old dubai and new dubai it has an amazing view you can see both of dubai's and see how dubai has imporved   last 20 years and if you visited """BERWAZ" "DUBAI""" you will see the glass path it's scary because you will feel that you are walking on air it sounds crazy but it seems that way . and an other development is the most importnant development that happened in the UAE where is sheik zayed bin sultan may he rest in peace turend the UAE from a place you can't plant or grow a single flower to  place wich is famous with palms and a place that produced dates and his highness opened the first girls school and the first hospital he changed the UAE from  dessert to a place many people visit it , and when they found oil it was a big move to  middle eastren region they stared to import and export oil so the income has become high so this  my opinion on what is the most importnant development. 
Social media is used by so many individuals. It has affected individuals and society positively and negatively. However, sometimes, social media can be unharmful, but the way you use it affects you drastically. Social media may affect you physically, mentally and socially. It can either be a positive affect or a negative affect. Youtube is used mostly by kids and teenagers which are the most vulnerable in society. It displays all sorts of categories like; music, cooking shows, sports, kids shows, etc.. Youtube is either healthy or unhealthy. Healthy, meaning there are people who live a healthy lifestyle that you may get influenced by.  Unhealthy, meaning there are people who constantly eat junk food and live an unhealthy lifestyle which also might affect you. Constant unhealthy eating lifestyle is very popular on Youtube, it is called """Muckbang""." Mentally being affected by social media is the worst type of affect on individuals and society. It mostly has a negative affect. You can get bullied in all sorts of ways. People might bully you because of your face, style, race, accent,  basically everything. Social media is known   for where individuals get mental illnesses. You can be affected due to the simplest things. However, you can also become mentally happy and stable due to the positive people you have surrounding you on social media, which is unlikely to happen. Being socially affected means you may either be very addicted to social media  which may lead you to avoiding other indivduals in reality  or using social media to contact individuals to meet in reality. However, people mostly get affected negatively which leaves people with no contact. In conclusion, social media is good and very educational only if you use it correctly.
How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media now a days has a great impact on our daily lives, we spend the majority of our day sitting on our phones posting stuff and watching others posts,and  that made us get away from people in real  and talk to people on the social media instead . when you think of the social media you the of the younger genartions ,because they are the  most effected people by it ,caring about the  looks,fashion,gaming  and other stuff are all  things younger genrations like to do ,and social media provides them with what they want to see. people create a life for them in the social media and they can also become famous  from what they post everyday,and   they show people that there life is perfect and that they are happy everyday  ,and by people watching them they may feel empty and wish that there lives could be like there's , many teengers have had depression from watching people's lives on social media ,because seeing others lives be so perfect and your's is not this will make you hate your life and not  except  it.social media can also be so dangerous for children because there are people in the social media that makes fake accounts to sseduce kids , and that is a major affect for the s
These days having a smart device is essential because with that you can keep up with what's happening all around the world and communicate with people from the other side of the globe and it's actually hard to live in the 21'st century without having a social media acount. Social media has a huge effect on society wether it's negative or positive, let's look at the positive sides of social media, since almost everyone has a social media account you can contact your friend and share photos with the through social media platforms and also it's easier for celebrities to communicate with their fans also you can share and look for many helpful information and researches posted on social media platroms, but there are negative sides such  certain rumors that cause arguments through social media or influencers who support the wrong side while some people would be against it, some would follow their wrondoings, especially kids since they tend to copy elders the most, one very important negative side of social media on inviduals is loosing confidence after looking at a comment that puts you down which gets you low self esteem, as individuals of society we should encourage more people about the right use of social media.
The UAE is a home to many people, most of which are not from here. There are so many more immagrants and settlers in the UAE than there are locals; This means that there are people from different backgrounds, cultures and religions. The UAE's citizens must show respect, acceptance and tolerance towards all individuals as people have the right to express themselves. There are so many ways the UAE could promote tolerance, one way they could do that is by starting events specifically to introduce people to different cultures; People could attend and learn about cultures. Being able to be tolerant towards everyone means you cannot be ignorant. People need to be educated to understand that it's okay if people were different to them. Since the UAE is a muslim country, it is especially important from people to promote tolerance here. Islam is all about peace and tolerating people of different religions and ethnic backgrounds.
Using social media increased gradually within most of the socities. There are both positive and neagtive impact of using social media within individuals. Nowadays, socities,  peoples are using social media to communicate easily with people around the world. I believe that teenagers are the most people using social media in the   way they use  in their free times to free up their stress within school or university work. Parents before were nervous about why their child play video games but now everything had changed and  internet show up which they are more worried. Firstly, social media allow individuals to easily look  what is going around them by entering for example,  Instgram app and look up breaking new or he/she is intersted in fashion so they look up  category  fashion and see what is new in  shops  maybe it is her taste and so on. Secondly, social media made it easy to communicate within people all around the world by using  developed app. in addition, social media allow people to learn and understand different countries cultures that it is intersted to he/she. Learning  different culture allow individuals to enhance their knowledge and be familier with differnet countries culture. Learning new stuffs allow the individual to give better opinions in differnet sectors within its own country and develop countries economics, hospitality and etc... Thirdly, In my opinion using social media in your free times is much better than sitting and do nothing, because the brain must have an activity going on and brainstorm things surronding the perosn. In conclusion, social media has a great impact in our daily life usage because life has changed and  population increased exponantially so social media made it easy to commuinacte with different people all around the world.
a) In my personal opinion, the UAE already promotes a culture of tolerance by having a spectrum of cultures mixed together. The UAE is one of the most diverse places I know, I grew up in an environment where I learned tolerance and acceptance from a young age. Tolerance and acceptance is one  of the side effects of growing up in a diverse culture and society,  being born into a world full of different faces, backgrounds, and races. Learning to love all and tolerate all comes easy in a place like the UAE and I've never been more proud to call a place home. Everyone in the world can become more tolerable, there is no place that has achieved maximum tolerance, but it is a significant place where  UAE is starting on its path of tolerance.
The UAE is one of the most constantly changing and developing countries in the world. Whether it is a social, academic, or constructional development, The UAE will most probably be developing and eventually excelling at it. It is an accepting country with a diverse range of people living in it. I personally thing that the most important developments in the UAE are the ones that involve the society, Because no matter how amazing the schooling is, or how luxurious the destination might be, If the society is not loving and accepting towards one another then it would not have as many tourists as it would if it was. The tolerance movement in The UAE has helped the society become more familial with one another and it resulted in the tourism to spike. The UAE hand signal ( Peace, Love and Victory ) has designed a nation which is known for its peace and serenity with different cultures and ethnicities. The tourism in the UAE would not be so successful if the society was not so loving. If the UAE did not have as much luxury as it does now, but the society was just as amazing, then i can guarantee you that tourism would not  be affected because we have other things to offer (Culture, pearl diving market, fish market, agriculture, gold, and diversity). so in conclusion, The most important developments in the UAE are the societal developments because they control most of the UAE's success.
Social media has a huge impact on society and individuals especailly in the current generation, and it has became an essenical in our daily lives . Social media has its advantages and disadvantages it either can benefit the person or harm them, but  from the advantages of social media is that  is it a very entertaining tool when your bored  not having anything to  but and social media may motivate the person to work hard and study because social media contains many motivational pages to push the person to work hard and social media will make help the person develop social skills because of the interactions that occur while using social media, but in the other hands there  many disadvantages of social media like the excess usages of social media will result to many health problems such as the loss of eye sight and complications in the brain, and another disadvanatage is the loss of self esteem that is caused by cyberbullying, and as a students we might stay on social media all day and forget to study which will result on the decrease of the grades . In my opinion as much as social media is important to our lives we should restrict ourselves to  couple  hours a day because using it to much can cause many serious health problems.
In a world of change, a world of continous ongoing movements, technology has prospered to reach levels never reached before. It consumes our daily habits, routines, and ways of living. Though it proved to be a tool that guides humanity towards a promising future, it does come with its own drawbacks and negativities. One of its branches being the media has tremendously changed throughout the years, as it started with the radios to televisions to phones  nowadays, to give a voice to those unheard, whether it being  awareness of minorities or promoting ideas with the power of affecting fractions of the world at once. Social media has provided the chance of connecting between individuals, societies, countries, and cultures. Though these connections proved to be an amazing way of eliminating barriers, it also gave chances to those spreading malice to affect larger groups of individuals at once. A simple message spouting ideas could be read by millions and cause them to either be affected positively or negatively.  Simplest of examples would be those individuals with  strong attachment to the environment, they would use social media to spread awareness at a greater scale across the world to make people see what the world is coming to and what they could do to stop it. But not everyone has such good motives. For some would try to encourage everyone to break the law and wreak havoc simply because they have the power to do so. Social media is a powerful yet dangerous place, for it attracts those with weak spirits to its entrances with disguises of wealth and happiness. Those thinking that wealth is equated with power would find themselves stealing, pretending, and faking just to get the satisfaction of receiving other people's envy and supposed respect. It is a never ending cycle of observing, communicating, and giving back. It is up to us to decide if we would use it to make our world a better place, or participate in the event of bringing it to its ultimate doom.
Social media nowadays affect so many individuals and society today, however many wonder why does it affect so many people. Social media today are websites and applications like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many other social media platforms. Society use social media as a platform to reach people all around the world, it's easier to connect with people through social media cause it represents who you are as an individual from the things you share online. So many musicians and actors use social media to advertise their work rather than magazines, and tv apperances cause its one click away. Many individuals also use social media as a career. Regular people have jobs as influencers because of social media, because of the followers they have and the influence they have on people online from all around the world. They start using it as a way to get paid and doing advertisements on instagram or any other social media platform. Society gets affected by people on social media or the person they can be  with the help of the internet you can be anything. People are effected by social media cause its a gateway to not be yourself and not show everything about you, you filter away your personality and show the people what you want to show about you rather than everything. I believe that social media affects people in a good way although many get lost from the real world by using it, others find themselves with the help of social media. You could make millions of dollars now with social media, you can be a creator and a entertainer with the use of the internet. You can also forget about the real world and the problems you face by watching the entertainors and creators on social media.
Social media is important in our world now like i mean it so important we do use it in everything in our life and it does have  good way and  bad way in our inviromant , How can we use it in  good way is by making ourself better like we study from it or it help us with our daily life or with our jobs etc . social media is really helpfull but its also can damge a lot of people by being  adected to it or by doing   things that lead them to a bad life  can change their life and thinking . So social media have so much effect in our life but we have to know how to use it and how to be carefull from it , like you need to know  social media is not your whole life that will give you everything you want social media helps you to do things easier ,stop trusting people online so fast and giving everyone your pravite informations protect your phone , laptop from unknown website , dont let social media control you  ,you control social media and social media is not a bad thing but you have to know how to use it and how to make it effect you in  good way only .
During this era, most of the people are using social media all ages and genders . social media is what people cant live without nowadays, people are on social media all the time it has a big affect on individuals and society ,some of the affects are negative and some are positive . The negative side is that they spend their whole time on social media and some of the individuals are faking a personality that is tottaly different from their real one, just to seem cool in front of others, and people may share their personnel informations over their and just regret it later on. The positive affects is that people will be having new friends and they may also have work through social media like instagram they can do some advertising if they have followers. And people can also communicate with people they didnt see for years through social media .Social media is what made people know the trends and everything new it affects the society in a good way because everything new happens people will know about     without searching for it social media made our lives much easier because you can do and find everything you need through it.
Social media affects individuals and society a lot, because a lot of people copy them if they did something like wearing some revealing cloth, or do something illegal. People should know that not everything social media people do they must do it to, because it may affect them in the end. Some children also get affected by them because they watch what the social media people do and then does the same even though it may affect them in the end or destroy there life's. Moreover, people should not copy cat other's because it's wrong and maybe it will change them to a new character which will affect there life skill and other thing's. Some families don't want that to happen to there children because they may do some wrong thing's and it will be too late to change or correct the mistake they did. A lot of girl's that are in age 12 put make up this days because they so some famouse people in Youtube that did the same and tout them to do it, in the end it will affect them because they are still young for that and they should not play with this thing's at all. I believe that social media will affect the society and individuals in the end because it causes a lot of problems in some people's life.
How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media has a huge affect impact on childeren  adults and on our society in general,in  many different ways. it can affect you by the person you like or the person that influences you by doing a certain action.it  can make the siciety change by one video posted on the internet or on social media.It  can make you a bad prson if you were influenced by the wrong people that might have bad actions  this is on an individiual or a teenage or even a child while on a society it can make you go to jail for one iresponsable action that can lead to a crime and if childeren are used ot having crimes all the time around them then it will be normal for them to comet one and to have illegl bahvior.second  but not last in our generation and on our kids and society its bad to get influenced by anyone because people have different oppenions and ideas which leads to many different actions and thoughts that can make you act differently.last  but not least people have different openions on many things so you just have to do what you think is  best for you.
How Does Social Media Affect Individuals and Society? Social Media is a big world that's hidden in our devices. This big world has many affects on people that we don't actually realize, there are positive and negative affects on individuals and on the society. Social media can be very harmful that people reach the level of suicide, and thats  from the bullying and shaming it brings to people, and some people in social media hide their identity to do illegal activities. Addiction to Social media is a big issue specially nowadays that even children have devices and can access social media.In  this side of the topic, there are endless positive and negative outcomes, like pulling people away from their families and friends yet keeping them in touch only by social media. The only connection to their families who live in the same building can only be by social media, and that causes people to be in a hole all by themselves with their devices and not seeing the actual real world. However, there are still a few positive outcomes. Social media can connect you to people from other countries, and lets you meet new people which actually helps people who are anti social, but too much of it can make you anti social if you're not.It  can also pave a way to bringing new ideas or give your thoughts and opinions on situations to the public. Businesses even use social media, in fact, it's probably the best way to advertise since your just a touch away from the whole world. I personally use social media a lot, but I try managing or balancing my time with the outside, and i feel like thats the best way nowadays since social media is a huge part in our day to day lives.
Social media has been one of the most popular ways of communicating lately especially in this generation.Many  people are fond of social media and applaud it, but how does social media really affect the society?Almost  everyone in this generation uses social media, but many people actually think that social media has a bad effect on the society, why?Well  let me list a few reasons. One of the most common reasons that social media has a negative affect on the society is that people get easily addicted to it and once they are addicted they have no interaction with the outerworld  whatsoever.You  might think that it is only the younger generation that are addicted to social media but in reality the older generation is also addicted to social media.Do  you notice how many people do not have a gathering to chat anymore?That  is because they think it is better to just communicate with one another while they are relaxed, now as much as that is true people still need to communicate with each other every once in a while. Another negative effect that social media has on society is that many people tend to get bullied through social media, therefore  have low self esteem and confidence. Many kids also get addicted to social media and start getting hostile if they are taken away from it and may start getting low grades. I do think that social media is a great way to comunicate with one another but it has to be used in the correct way rather than being sunked into the social media community and becoming addicted to it.
Social media affected the lives of people, some believe it affected them negatively while others believe that it chnaged their lives to the better. I believe that social media will be one of the reaaons behind why people will stop being social. Opinions differ, but i believe that the mind sets of people because of social media began to change and all that people care about is popularity. Social media is one way for people to get together and communicate with one another but it also can destroy ones life in a matter of seconds. Teenagers specifically can easily get scammed and catfished and not only that but children of all ages are bullied on social media which can negatively affect their lives. Because of social media, people would sit at home all day browsing through different applications rather than going to the mall. This would not only affect their lifestyle but would also affect their health. Laziness is one main affect and another is eye sight problem. One of the main reasons behind why a large amount of people wear galsses is that they spend their quality time on theor phones. In conclusion,I  believe that social media has a negative affect on our society and that people should consider using social media less even though its an easy way to communicate with others
The United Arab Emirates has a lot of new and modern developments that has improved the nation enormously. The following are some developments that I consider the most important in the UAE at the moment. In my opinion, the most important developments in the United Arab Emirates at the moment is the awareness of people with determination. For a very long time people with determination have been suffering with the lack of privileges and services, such as; sports, art, and many more. One of the great accomplishments of the UAE is helping the athletic people with determination by hosting the Special Olympics 2019 in Abu Dhabi, which helped spread awareness and show people that if any person could do this, people with determination can also do it. The UAE has helped people with determination a lot by offering facilities and services to the people with determination. Another thing that I consider  important developments in the UAE at the moment is tolerance, no matter who you are, where you are from doesn't matter,  you are always welcome and respected.  Tolerance of the Emirate nation is a very important development, as it welcomes people from all around the world. The year of tolerance is such a lovely reminder to remind the people   basic principals of humanity.
Social media has taken everything in our life they use it daily and this had effect our daily life and our future ,people have lots of social media and people in this time loves social media, i see in our daily time  most people uses socail media and this effects us from it thats why in this generation socail media must be  less in our time and  lot of people must contact with other people spically family and friends. people in this generation had lost to many conection with their family becouse of socail media and they cant sit together becouse of  that,Social media is a diifret universe in this world becouse if had effect our society and our life and this will let us lose intrest in seeing others.Socail  media made everything easy thats why people loved it and its the best way that people could live with it thats why they shoild stop living the socail media life and start seeing lots of people and contact with them so they can see the diffrence from social media and staying together. In conclousin i think that they must stop socail media so they can see the diffrennce they have in their life insted  sitting and chatting in their phones.
In the last decade we were introduced to the newest technology that has completely changed our lives both negatively and positivity. Social media has made life so much easier from many aspects, it made it easier for people to communicate and for people to study from many sources and made entertainment available right in our homes, on the other hand, a lot of people misused social media. Teenagers and children have been provided with smart phones and other types of devices and there is no limit of use to them.  Social media consumed the lives of many, problems like losing confidence, lack of sleep, losing temper, loss of memory, and becoming less social as well as being dependent, all of this can be prevented if parents were more strict about how long their children use social media, allowing them only to use it for 2-4 hours instead of 8 hours can make a huge behavioral and social difference in the children's characteristics. Not only children can be affected by social media, but also adults. Older women and men can face many issues with themselves, especially women, whom tend to wander on social media and browse other women's pages, and start lowering their self-esteem by comparing their own bodies and occupations to   other women. There are men all over the word working to support their families financially, but there are men that over-work to provide their family  more than enough and forget the importance of bonding, they will keep taking phone calls and emails even when they're back home and never spend crucial time with their loved ones. All in all, social media can be really useful and help you in many ways,  but only if you use it the right way, and it can be harmful if you use it the wrong way.
Social media is something thats so important in our generation, like instagram, twitter, snapchat,  whatsapp. People use it for different reasons. Social media has many positive things and negative things. Life would be hard without social media  I mean hard that social media makes things simple and easier to be done, like advertising some products , making new friends from different countries around the world. Some people use it in a wrong way, they share their personal things that shoudnt be shared with others. Some people post their pictures and selfies then they get bullied by others and other people use those pictures for other things and it affects the person, and some of them friend people that they shoudnt be a friend with. Its really dangours for kids and social media shoudnt be used by kids there is many things that they shoudnt know about and for sure they learn the bad words from the things they watch and any other applications they use. Many famous people advertise for products that they dont really know about and if its  really good or anything and the only thing they do this for is money.
Socail media are the most used program in this centery.

The bad thing is  its so addicting and a waste of time when you use it in the wrong way.

Social media is a huge part of the world, the world use social media as  easier way to communicate with each other. Most people use social media to interact with friends and family from the other part of the world. Futhermore, social media can be used to sell products which businesses now days do for profit. More likely, social media is louder then people who speak the media speaks louder, people can say things around the world freely. Firstly, social media was used to reach out to people around the world, yet it caused much trouble around the world. people started using it  bully others and it caused a lot of depression to teenagers, whom use the internet for fun. Moreover, social media created a cold war between people and between religions, which caused a lot of deaths in the past years. People end up commiting crimes. Individuals became heartless. Secondly, it effected most teenagers self confidance, teens spend their time browsing through the web watching their favorite celebrities. Although, most social media influncers use photoshop to look good in photos,yet  teenagers try to look alike their favorite people. They end  going under the knife to look similar to these photoshopped people. In conclusion, social media has it's pros and cons, but others use it wrong and some use it to reach out to family or friends. People are effected by what they see , teenagers use it as  fun way to waste time , but they bully others and some get depressed.
social media has progressed throught the years and is one of the most used platforms in the world. it can either have a positive impact on individuals and society or a negative one. first of all, one of the most useful thing about social media is that it is one of the best ways to connect with family and meet new people who have the same intrests as you. moreover, news spread like fire in social media which can be beneficial to individuals since it informs people about things like weather updates and whats happening around the world. second of all, because social media has some useful things, it also has  negative impact like cyberbullying. Which can cause a person to be depressed or even commit suicide. secondly, social media can be higly addictive becuase people are worried about their reputation and what others think of them which can lead them to not be productive and having no privacy. in conclusion, socail media can be beneficial if it was used in the right way like commmunicating with family and friends and looking for updates other than  cyberbullying and keeping no privacy to yourself.
As technology developed, social media took a huge part of our daily life. Social media is a very broad feild, its content can be beneficial and non-beneficial. Social media includes applications such as snapchat, instagram, twitter, facebook, and etc. Social media affects individuals and societies in many ways that can be both good and bad. Each individual uses social media in a different way. Some people use social media to keep in touch with friends and family memebers that live far away. Some other people use social media to expose themselves to people from other cultures and expand their knowledge of any topic they desire. In such cases, social media has a positive effect on the individual. On the other hand, there are some people that follow up with popular figures on social media that promote wrong ideas and influence their thinking in a way that does not suit the mindset that they grew upon.  Social media makes it easier for bullys to bully people without an identity, this can lead to many mental illneses. Those examples illustrate how social media can effect an individual badly. A group of individuals make up a society. Therefore, how  social media effects the indivduals, it will effect the society as a whole. If the individuals used social media in a way that will add to them and inspire them to do more and to be better, the outcome will be a society full of positive energy and that will make it develope and provide  next generations with a better future. Although, if individuals abused social media in bad manner, it will only make the society go backward in all aspects and that will effect their lives in a bad way. All in all, social media effect you depending on the way you use it. Moreover, the acts of individuls make up the full image of society. Individuals are responsible of either developing and society or demoloshing it.
in the past few years the humanity have been in  process of development for their future and in order to make life simple for them and much easier for them, and one of the ways of development is the communication,  the last few years in the new generation, the ipads and such as devices have came out to this world to make life simple for us, communication is one of the new accesses humanity have gained from this development. people nowadays have learned how tp use technology in order to communicate, and the social media apps have showed in the last few years taking a big place in the humans life, the social media have it positives and negatives, but most importantly it made communication around the world more simple, yes a lot of people are addicted but its unhealthy to waste your time on social media instead of doing real life activities. the social media didnt affect one country or  specific group of people, it did affect the whole glabal and made them one community who shares their life moments and enjoy texting others, but that made the roumors spread faster between the world of false stuff which causes troubles, and made this community getting toxic and it only accept the things they think its fine and not what is really fine. in my persoal opinion i think that the social media is a weapon with two edges, it can be positivly used for  good sake and it can be used negativly to destroys lives and make people become depressed, it's not the fact of why we use it, it's how we use it
How has social media affected people? It has affected people in a postive way and also as a negtavie way. There has been many side effects, people have struggled from depression ,anxiety, and other mental disorders, due to social media. A teenage girl the other day posted on twitter a vote  if she should commit sucicde or no. She sadly got more votes that she should kill herself, hours later this young beautiful teenage girl took her life away. People on social media have played her and also various of other people. Social media also has a postive impact on people, many people have started busiensses. A couple of busiensses that I know off have termindsly grew because of social media, they used those applactions to advertise their business, and after that it has been really succseful. For exapmle Home Bakery this women has become an enterpenour she started selling cookies, she took orders through Instgram and posted pictures of her cookies. She started small just by opening a page on Instgram, she eventually started getting famous and, got a lot of orders. Now she has a couple of coffee shops in dubai, and  is a millionare. Instgram, Snapchat, Youtube, and many other apps. Gave people the oppurtunity to be interpenures  by selling clothing,  food,  filiming their life style, and also a chance of being famous. It really depends on how a person uses those applactions, in my point of view children shouldn't have any type of social media without an adult, because they don't know betwen right and wrong, and they do get affected really quickly.
 Garden in the Desert The UAE is currently the leading country in surpassing past achievements;  setting new standards to development. For even amidst the desert sand, a tree grew to then form a garden of them, shaping our society and culture to expect the unexpected. Furthermore, the UAE has broke down the walls to many barriers to being successful. Sheikh Zayed  AlNahyan, the finest of all rulers, was able to build love in each citizens heart which then allowed him to use that love to better this spectacular country. For it's the steps he took that made each person take pride and want to take his country to the top ranks. So till this day, the people in the UAE still strive to accomplish the unaccomplished. For example, Masdar city is a city that uses no electricity; however,  uses solar energy in order to light up streets, buildings, and even food trucks. Not only that, but the UAE has managed to break down borders built to put woman down, but managed to build towers that could lift woman up. To add to that, the awareness found in the UAE is like no other, for especially this year, the year of tolerance, was named to help showcase a topic that's been discussed worldwide. Furthermore, the love built years ago by his Highness Sheikh Zayed, still beats through each person's heart making them proud yet still wanting more for this wonderful garden in the desrt. In conclusion, no accomplishment will be the last, for in this land of pride nothing feels as if it's enough. Seven emirates beat with one heart, all running to win in this race of countries trying to surpass the other. But in the end, it is the country which finds itself building its pillars on a wise mans words and a nation with an open heart  winning.
Social media plays a huge role in most people's lives no matter how old or young. It has both negative and postive effects to individuals and the society. For some individuals, the use of social media is a means of communication between one another and  way to feel connected with the rest of the world. However, it sometimes becomes harmful to these individuals because they become addicted to this form of communication and disconnect themselves from the outside world. Social media has opened new doors for corruption in the society because individuals can commit crimes whether it is theft or cyberbullying, they can do it anonmously, therefore allowing more and more people in the society to become corrupted. So, the actions of these individuals on social media affects the society entirely, either positively or negatively.
Social media affects society and individuals in a variety of ways. Some are positive and have benefited the world greatly, serving in great ways to make life easier. Other ways are negative and have paved a path  alot say is one that leads to our futures destruction. Moreover, the positive affects of social media are countless. Social media has opened the gates to free communication;  """free""" as in limitless, at any time, and place. Another pro is the fact that it has opened the doors to peoples personal lives,  everything is posted online. This is a great benefactor and comes in handy with companies and businesses; because, knowing peoples details they can specifically target them with their advertisments. Furthermore, there are also many negative sides to social media. In fact, some may say the cons outweigh the pros. Social media has created a lack of human contact. This is due to it providing an easy way of online communication, hence people have become lazy when it comes to face to face interactions. Another major con is the emphasis it placed on the financial gaps between people in the world. Although these gaps existed before, people werent as aware of it as they are now due to everyones details  posted on a page. In a nutshel, social media as revolutionized the way the world works. It has benefited humans greatlly but also it has become their biggest foe. With that  said, control is always in the hands of the user.
c) Social media has taken a big place in our society, it has it advantages and its disadvantages. I'm going to be talking about the advantages and disadvantages about social media and how it affects our society. Social media has given us a very easy way to communicate and to stay close with people who are disstant, it also made edducation a lot easier and simple. If you needed to study about a certain time you can simply watch a movie that talks about ancient times. social media has made edducation simpler, eisser, and probbably for most people a lot more interesting. However, people are not controling themselves and not using social media in the it should be used. People are using social media which has led to  alot of deggative results like, lazziness, lack of communication skills, social media addiction and a lot more. Social media has made us  alot less acctive which made  alot of people unhealthy. If social media addiction developes in the next few years people are not going to be able to communicate and express there feelings to others which makes life  alot less meaningfull. I thinks social media is extreamly affective and can have its positives and negatives, but the important thing is to use it in the right way.
Through out the years,  new generation have come carrying new things,  new developments and yet   more to  come.Social media is one of the things that has come to our world, society and minds, it took all of our attention through out the years. Social media made things easier for everybody, social media reunited friends and family whom are thousands of miles away as well as for lazy people. Social media has negative and positive points like any other things in this world. Social media impacted people in different ways, it's negativities may hurt others mentaly and physicaly. Some use the application in a bad way, but some aren't aware of what and how they use these applications and by that we mean elders and others. Cyber bullying is the main negative point in social media, it made many people commet suiside in different ways, it made people stop their careers,or,stop   eating like the way they  use to and, many other stuff. It also have an impact on society, creating problems between countrys,  cities and many other stuff that us, the society, doesnt have  to do something with it. Stealing information is something common that we see everywhere, the main cause of it is us the users, posting our private informations in any website or even application,  can cause us to loseing what we have. Hacking is the same way around, stealing photos,  credit card information which we aren't supposed to post it or save it anywhere in our devices,  getting our personal information such as  street or adress which leads to house stealing when this is another case to open. Posting plane tickets on instagram, twitter, facebook, or any other applications, can lead us also to problems with our private information. People use these stuff due to show off to people, or even maybe to have fun which there's nothing fun about posting our personal information. People have to learn and know the wrong things that could happen with anything we use. As mintioned before, everything has negativity and positivity, that doesn't mean that social media is harmeful for everybody, people who can use it and have the full knowledge about how to use it, they won't find any problems. Use the social media carefuly and don't post anything on it,  it can come  around you and cause you  problems more than you think.
Social media is an applications that we use to communicate with others and discover other cultures , its a double-sided-weapon  you either use it wisely or you just ruin your life by doing wrong choices . Our generation has been creative and smart more than the past generation because they can access anything and everything easily , they don't need to learn it as if they are born with the skills, as i said before social media has open our eyes to so many things , you just need to teach your children where , when and what to use  media in general , because some of them has used it wrong and destroyed their life and other peoples life , so either you tell them and punish them or don't be sad if the kids has become what you didn't expected . Social media effect us individually it makes us more like an alone person with poor communication skills , scared of the outside , and maybe depressed ! for that matters . there are many cases and diseases has  showed up since social media came to the world , like : autism , depression elc... , diseases we have to fix   for it kills us LATTERLY becaue with  internet and video games some of those young people has killed each other for some dumb stuff . In the other hand on the level of society , there are some dangerous and research has proven that the percentage of deaths and suicides has increased thruoghout the time , and parents are not aware of the dangor around them and that affects their kids . Although the many many cons of social media there are many benifits , because social media helped us with our lives , work , studies , knowledge in general . we have to make people aware if what they might face , or what could happen .
Topic (c) Social media is an important part of our life because we use social media the whole day . Social me affect every body because it influnce people  how to live how to act  how to even feel. This generation faces many problems because they watch bad influncers on Twitter or Snapchat for example kids or even teenagers did not live their life well because they always face bullying problems and they think they are bigger than their age , so that makes the community to be destroyed and people face many emotional problems people do not see the real world they just live the social media life . Social media on the other hand may be good in some ways it makes people connected and study better because you really can understand. That makes people fell the warmth and not  alone and if some thing happened you can reach  to the police by online apps or call them and if you are facing problems you can reach  to the person you want. That some times makes the society connected and express their feelings about a problem or their thoughts. In conclusion social media is good if people took it in a way that develop the society and if not it will destroy the society  it is between their hands.
Social media can affect each kind of person if he cant control himself, social media could help the person , in the other hand social media could destroy the person. Each one of us today are using social medial.  Adults, teanagers, kids, old men, etc. Nowadays, each kind of person is using social media daily (YOUTUBE), they can see things that could help them in  future,  help them in their studies,  get a benefit from social media. In the other hand, they could watch things that could destroy them and end their life easily. Social media could affect the person individualy, by doing   stupid things such as, watching things that you dont need to watch +18, thinking about things that you could not reach at, watching people that they are above your level and you could do any thing to reach to their level ( buying an expensive car). At these days, in  UAE, KSA,  randomly in our religon, each housband took a video with his wife to be famous and have more money, and these kind of things in our religon is not good. Kids will think in the future to take videos with their wifes. Also, in Instagram, each month there are new challenge, such as  bottle challenge , plastic bag challenge etc. These small thing could affect the society and change there way of thinking. In conclusion, each person need to be responsible at his self, also we need to watch our kids to  what they are sharing in social media or what they are watching. I hope that you've get my message and get a new informations.
Social media is a fast growing platform in which it is affecting individuals and society, hence like everything social media has it pros and cons. When it comes to these applications people must be aware what there actions as these could have serious consequences. People like celebrities and influencer's have major impacts on these platforms, which means they should be aware of what they upload, tweet etc. For example, if someone has thousands or millions of followers and he/she uploads something wrong or inappropriate they need to think about the number of people that are going to view this post and are going to be affected as they may idolize that particular person. In some cases social media is a amazing way to promote worldwide problems like countries suffering from poverty and war zones. Another great example of where social media has come in handy,  and this happened recently.  Is when no one knew that the amazon rain forest was on fire and not a single news outlet was reporting the problem. This news was so important as that exact rain forest provides us with about 20% of our oxygen, without that and  us as humans releasing all these bad things into the air we wouldn't all be around for much longer. Like everything else social media has its positive and negative aspects so its up to that person to else it in the correct way.
Social media is a widely controversial subject with various opinions regarding its negative and positive aspects. While social media has many positive impacts on society, it can also imprint many negative changes on people worldwide. Social media is widely used as a means of communication between people. Social media lifts boundaries made by long distances and creates roads that can easily connect people to one another. However, if not used correctly, those roads can lead to dead ends and cause individuals more harm than good. As the use of social media increased, studies have shown a simultanious increase of false information or news being shared by people. This can cause harm to societies due to the lack of trust between people. False information or rumors being spread can also stir alliances between countries. Also, bullying on the internet has become much easier to do since it can be anonymusly done. Since social media allows people to wear masks, it has been proven by psychology that it allows people to be more comfortable being harsh on others. This causes people to lose their lives and mental health due to bullying through social media. In conclusion, there are many positive and negative impacts of social media. Therefor, it is important to raise awarness on the dangers of social media to help limit the negative impacts it can cause on individuals and societies.
Nowadays, social media has become widespread and a crucial method of communication, as it affects society and its members in various ways. First of all, since everyone has access to these social applications, they can be used to spread awareness. For example, when the Amazon Rainforest was set on fire, many people started to spread awareness, and set up donations for reforestation and to the indegenious people who lost their homes. This way, social media helped people save the environment and people's lands through crisis aid websites, such as Go Fund Me. Also, social media can be used for many educational purposes. Many academic websites make tests and provide knowledge or books to people around the world, thus improving people's analytical and thinking skills. Although, there are many benefits to social media, spending too much time on it can cause psychological issues. For instance, many people who start blogs may get negative comments from others, which may sometimes lead to self hatred. Also in extreme cases, the person may develop anxiety or depression. It is  best to use social media for the right purposes, so everyone could live healthily and enjoy what these sites have to offer.
Centuries ago communicating with others was very hard and complicated. Nowadays we have technology and multiple ways to communicate with others specially through various apps of social media. Social media hase many advantages and disadvantages depending on how it is used, social media has a huge affect on individuals and societies as a whole. It helps famillies and friends etc to communicate by using variouse apps like Skype. On the other hand socila media has disadvantages as well that affects individuals and the society through bullying,  spreading fake news that causes problems between different communities  even countries which leads the society to falling apart. Social media hase a huge impact on our daily lives    to follow up on daily news,  following other influencers for motivation etc. Nowadays we all use different types of social media for variouse reasons and one of the most main reasons is to communicate with others to follow up with them specially  for  long distance between each other. In conclusion social media is very important for the majority of our society and is very much used to communicate and to remain updated for variouse occasions to know what to expect in the next coming  day,month,year  etc.
Social media is so important to people nowadays, and it has a huge affect on people and society. Social media is consisted of apps that people can chat or share posts through such as Snapchat, Whatsapp, Instagram, and so  on.Social media has both positive and negative affects on peoples life. Although  negative affects are more than the positive one's, but still their are positive affects that help the society. Negative affects has a huge impact on society that ristricts and ruins peoples lives. Examples of negative affects are: first, spending lots of hours on social media apps checking others posts and chatting with friends  that affects your vission. Another affect is not spending time with family,  lack of excersice which makes you obese and with bad health,  chatting with strangers that might steel you, as well as affecting the childs life by   spending many hours on videos with lack of good information which might even make the child a more introvert person than an extrovert one. People  getting affected by bloggers and famous people and buying the things they buy and eating the food they eat instead of having their own personality,  teenagers  viewing eighteen plus and abusive contents that might lead to problems in the future. However, even if social media has  negative impact on people it also have a positive impact on indvidual and society. Some of the positive affects is easily finding the information you need by searching through the internet, learning about new cultures and traditions,  easily chatting with friends and face time calls. In conclusion, social media have been a part of peoples life and it has an affect on peoples lives, social media has both  negative and  positive impact on the society so people should learn to how to deal with it in  good way.
In this society, many people are on social media. They are either on it to promote a business or to communicate with friends, family and people all around the world. Lately social media has become toxic to society and especially to teenagers. Social media isn't the best for anyone's mental health, the amount of hate a person can receive through social media can be very damaging to someones confidence. It could ruin a person, it could cause someone to fall into depression. Keep in mind that the hate received from social media is from other individuals, all the hatred that is spread, its spread by people who carry hatred within themselves. Society would be a better and safe place if people would use these platforms to spread love and peace. Social media can bring out the worst in people, the amount of hours spent on these platforms is damaging to the human brain. Kids are being affected by this at a very young age, having their confidence crushed by people is a lot to handle at that age. If people started using social media for the right reasons it would have a better affect on individuals and society itself.
Social media is something that affects all people, whether it was in a positive or a negative way. People use social media everyday  to communicate with people, to meet new people, and to search and learn about things they do not know in life. Social media affects individuals in a positive way and in a negative way. The good thing about it is that it allows people to learn new things, to communicate with people in different places, and to learn things that will benefit them in their lives. The bad thing about social media is that it does not allow people to socialize and go out. Some people use social media most of their time and their family does not even see them. This is a bad thing because some people can become anti-social. Social media also affect people in a bad way because a lot of people get bullied on social media so it sometimes lead people to  suicide or hate their lives or they become insecure  they stop communicating with people around them. Social media also affects the society. The society changes according to social media. They start changing culture, the way they think, and the way they communicate with others. The society can even get destroyed because of social media, because some people may have an opinion about something that happened in social media and then the others do not agree or have different opinions, so they argue and people protest against the other people which can destroy the society and people will not be on good terms.
The United Arab Emirates went through an instant and rapid development throughout the last decades, these changes attracted international attention from all kind of people. Weather it could be started by the exploration of oil in the reagion or the announcement of the talest building in the world, at some point this small geographical area started to introduce itself through its achievements. Nevertheless, being in such a melting spot surrounded by this fast process could make it hard for us to ralize how it happened and its effects. The most recent major improvement was the new direction that the government took which is new to the region, yet it is the future which is inhancing technological inventions and evolving them into the everyday transactions. Moreover, all of the recources - starting from the encouragements to the physical materials and education - are widely open for people who are intereseted in this field including the young generation. Another changing point is how the economy of the country is shaping, the natural resource will finish one day and wheeling to another income is shifting slightly so it won't make that big of a change. However, it could be a boost to startup  and get in the high level to start up if invested correctly. For instance,  industrial field is getting wider each day also the tourisim sector gives a huge impact to the local economy. To sum up, the development is a countinuos process that couldn't end and we have to coup with it and be a part of it as a thank for our home.
No matter where you are, you'll always see people scrolling through their phones  either checking up the latest trends or """Snapchatting""" their moments to other people. Have you ever wondered if such little applications could cause a big impact on people? Social media has been one of the most used things in this generation, even the elders of every family have caught up on it. Snapchat, Instagram,  Facebook;  these applications may seem useless and complex but in reality, people have been spending endless hours on them. Little do they know, it's destroying their lives. The impact Socia media has on individuals is that it could cause  loss of connection with others in real life, hostility, and mostly bullying which, unfortunately, increased the rate of suicide of teenagers. Social media gives people a false image on the perfect life, it encourages people to hide behind masks and pretend to be someone they're not.  Infact, social media causes the society to follow unethical trends, which could possibly cause violence in the environment. However, there are some benefits that come from Social media, it helps people or family reconnect through video calls or messages that help people build stronger bonds. It also helps people learn  new traditions and culture. In conclusion, Social media has more negative effects than positive ones, which means people should watch out and start using them less frequently to avoid being an internet addict.

c) How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media has become a big part of so mant people's lives, social media influencers espically have become part of so many individuals lives. but social media has become some what of a disease and has impacted so many individuals lives both in  good and bad way. On a global scale social media has helped many share their day to day lives and share their stories, but many have mis-used social media, spreading hoax and causing as the teenagers call it """drama""," it has become the route to bullying and harrassment, the people have lost control of what they share online, they would never think they cause harm to someone else, or lead them to attempet the un-thinkable. Another point that should be taken to concideration is the models that post online, many would think they have the most perfect body and they live the most lavish lives, society has become based on how people live and what they have, many have forgotten what it means to be happy, they think the lavish things they get makes them happy,  the perfect body makes them happy, in reality this is the most depressing part. Money is what brings them happiness, it also will cause the downfall of society, when everyone loses all the moeny and family because of this so called """perfect" "life""" they were seeking for becuase they saw it in social media.. Globally this has effected society in both a good and a bad way, it all really depends on how the individual uses the social media,  are they seeking happiness?, distruction?,  just for fun?.

The United Arab Emirates has been known for being one of the fastest countries to develop when it comes to education, medicine and housing. And from the early seventies the UAE went through so many changes through out the history,  from traditional houses to few of the most advanced and modern houses and skyscrapers. The UAE has been ranked the first around the world to have built the tallest skyscraper  `burj khalifa`,  and has also built one of the biggest shopping malls in the world, known as. `The Dubai Mall`.This  mall has more the 2500 shops and restaurants! the UAE is also known for having more than five tourist attracting cities, such as Fujairah, Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Dubai and other several cities. The country is also known for being respectful towards everyone, and the locals have learned to be kind and tolerant to everyone from Sheihk Zayed, the founder of  UAE. The UAE has made  alot of advanced developments in the past 10 years. A few examples of which   they have built robots to work in cafes and restaurants, and also in some courts. The UAE also developed it`s own SAT and officialy released it in space last year. In my opinion, the UAE should keep invisioning the future and always strive for the better, and I have noticed some positive change in the locals including myself, and I`m looking forward to what the future holds, because  UAE has come far through the advanced technologies and future visions of  moderanised country.
The Important developments in the UAE The first crucial development in my opinion is, education here in the United Arab Emirates. The reason why I think that is because the majority of students are graduating from school and going to university where in the past if students did not like going to school it would be okay and their parents would agree for them to stay at home, especially the female students. However nowadays, parents are aware of that and they have more knowledge about how it could effect the student future in a negative way, so the majority of parents do not allowed their kids to drop out from school and instead they encourge them to finish school and after that continue with university. In addition to that, this draustic development is shown nowadays in particular with females because lot's of females now work not only that they work in the most important, crucial and high-level places in the United Arab Emirates like we have minsters and pilots and lot's of other different works. So I strongleagree  that this is, a big development in the United Arab Emirates which is a very postive .
B) What do you think are the most important development in the UAE at the moment? As we all konw nowdays in the UAE the studies are more important than bebore and it has change in a really good way, the most important thing  that it  developed strongly. study in schools, university and collage is different than before its not hard but they focus on it so much more, it is a great change for our beautiful country. There is many ways to study, of course we didnt forget the books  we still use it but, we also use Ipad or Laptop these days, it is diffcult sometimes for the kids who start going to school earelier, but our teachers try their best to teach them step by step and give them knowledge about the new topic. I honestly belive that this  a huge and good change, beacause it also will affect the name of our country in a good way, we are so proud of  UAE and  UAE is also proud of us. There is so many important developments in the UAE at the moment but, in my perspective i think this thing is really the most ipmortant. We are grateful for our leadrers and our country all the time not just by the moment.
The affect of social media on individuals and society As social media is     developing and evolving over the past and the following years the affect of it still lingers in our community, as an individual  alot can affect my personal and social life but most importantly social media leads a major factor in the change that we are now wittnessing, a simple word can start wars and a humble apology can bring up history. Viral videos are the easiest way to affect a human being both positively and negatively, nowadays news are spread in a split second and it is easier for people to access information and claim private content. Let us start with the most common negative use of social media that can really affect a person and could lead to serious danger such as cyberbullying, the most affected age range of cyberbullying starts from 12 until their late 20s, a fake or spam account on instagram is often used to bully youngesters and their posts and mostly can send negative threats which leads to a person losing their sanity, i would like to discuss the unfortunate recent case of Israa Ghareb a young talented makeup artist killed just because of her jealous cousins spread a rumor about her in the family so her father and brothers decided to take away her freedom of life, the summary of the story is that she took a video of her and her fiancé but her jealous cousin went to her father and told him that israa went out with a guy before her fiance and she needs to be punished, the moral of the case is that social media can really affect an individual in the most gruesome ways that a person could ever imagine of, but the society affect  side of that case, people on the streets were asked by several TV talk shows hosts about their prespective on this case and all of the sayings were absloutley negative and really shows how a society can be really shallow and irrational, by that TV show it conveys the mindset of a country and their reputation would be scared for life. I would also like to adress the recent major affect on our society  but positively, people are starting accounts on social media to spread awareness about the climate change and try to reach out to middle aged people and also teenagers and our society is doing amazing work in keeping up with the recent news and participating, so social media is a double sworded sword it could really affect an indivial or a society both negatively and positively, as i mentioned eariler a simple word in social media can start a war and a humble apology can bring up history but a positive viral trend or video can really affect us as individuals and society positively.
 U.A.E has developed drastically over the last few decades from infrastructure to being the home of globaly known businesses. It is still developing even after its huge achivements because we are always aiming to be number one on a global level. Therefore, one of the most imporatant developments in the United Arab Emirates in 2019 is EXPO 2020 that is a huge event that has been in the works since 2015 which will help the U.A.E to become a destination for investors and to help strengthen the relations between  U.A.E and other countries. In addition, EXPO 2020 is challanging  U.A.E based artists and designers to produce products related to the culture of  United Arab Emirates to teach vistors that the U.A.E is drived by its culture in every aspect of the country. In addition, I think that the design and art scene is developing in the U.A.E, meaning that there are more opportunities for designers and artists and more places that showcase art pieces for art enthusaites.
social media affects Social media is all over the world in the 21 centuary, and its something most of us relay on. the difrrencess bettwen us is how we use it and that affects ourselves and the socitey around us. Individuals can benfit from social media in many ways. for student they can contact with other classmates in simple clicks on the smartphone or laptop. Also its helpfull when bying somethig you can read the comments about any product on social media pages such as instagram. But if you use social media in a bad way like writing bad comments that will represnt your bad image to other people . Sociteys also can get  alot of things from social media.

To keep our society , culture , and families safe. we should all learn how to use social media in the right way . to get what we need and what can benifet us
we are living in a modern age where everything is done through computer machines. as the years went by, technology kept advancing and reaching new peaks. currently, the smartest machine is in everyone's hands, and that machine is the smart phone. almost everyone has a smart phone for the same reasons and those are taking pictures, calling people, and most commonly, using social media. social media is a great tool for communication and knowledge, but it is also the devil in disguise. since a majority of our society has multiple accounts on different social media sites, it is a boiling pot of a variety of people who can either spread toxicity or love. there are a lot of """trolls""" on the internet whose goal is to irritate others by using forms of bullying. traditionally, bullying is known to be done   face-to-face, but now it is commonly done on the internet. when someone posts a picture of themselves on instagram, they become exposed to millions of users, and if one percent of those users decide to leave a malicious comment, it can easily ruin the uploaders confidence and mental health. having said that, we have to acnowledge social media for being a learning resource. back then, people used to get their news from daily newspapers but now the news are updated every second on social networks like twitter. our society in general has become closer than ever thanks to the easy communication provided by social media.
A lot of people argue whether social media affect individuals and society or not. Does it? yes it does but both in negative and positive ways .Social media is a like a free playground where everyone can say, share,  post whatever they like with not much restrictions, Well this can be useful and benificail but sometimes it is harmful and negative towards specific groups of people like kids and people who are maybe from different cultures and who has different religions, the content May be offensive. and it affects people because they get influenced by you or try to copy what your doing whether it is good or bad.
Social media has been instilled into our society today to such an extent level that its virtually impossible that a person is not on any social media platform. Every one is on social media from young to old,  rich to poor. People use social media for many things such as socializing,finding  and sharing information and even shopping. These are just a few ways that social media can improve peoples lives.on  the other hand social media can be harmful and can cause stress and other negative outcomes. There are many social media platforms to chose from; some of the popular ones are facebook, snapchat, twitter and instgram. As the populatry of social media is is huge and reaching all over the world there are mixed feelings on these networks and how they impact peoples day to day life.Social media has a lot of positive sides it can can have a positive effect on business, politcs and socializing. Through these interactions, people can share ideas, get information and also get exposed to many opportunities. Social media also gives people the apportunity to make new friends and also maintain old friends by simply communicating with them. On  negative side of things it may cause things such as cyberbullying, invading in privacy and fake news. In conclustion i think social media is a great thing and can really evolve peoples life for the better if they use it they right way. people should be careful with hackers and fake news and should also resctict themselves from overusing social media and sharing too much.
Social media is a big element in people's lives, whether they're children, teenagers or adults. When people go out to eat, they instagram it. When they go to an amusement park, they snapchat it. It has almost become a habit to pick up your phone and take a photo of your plate the minute it gets to your table. Whether it's to update their profile or keep up with other people, we always find ourselves refreshing and switching between apps to make sure we're up to date with everyone and everything. However, what some people turn a blind eye to is the enormous negative affect and influence social media has on us. There are different types of social media apps but they all share one thing in common. People use it to showcase their lives on the internet. It could be a selfie, a landscape photo or what they had for lunch. On the other hand, it's mostly selfies that take over those feeds. It could seem like an innocent photo a celebrity or social media infleuncer shared of themselves. What they don't realize is the thoughts they're planting in people's heads, especially teenagers. Social media sets an unrealistic standard of beauty in our society. For instance, when Kylie Jenner got her lips done and shared a selfie, it had so many negative comments of people not supporting her choice. Yet just a few weeks later, our feeds were filled with people that were replicas of Kylie. Somehow, big lips turned into a beauty standard in the matter of a few weeks, all because of a selfie. Social media could also be a place for people to sell products and pay influencers to sponsor them. You can't deny it, if you saw your favorite celebrity or influencer post about a product them claim to """love""," you'd want to get it too. At the end of the day, it could be the reason they have clear skin or a thin body. There were some beauty supplements that went around for a while. Many infleuencers had this company's back and posted their products claiming they have used them and have lost weight. That was until the supplements had to be taken off the website and tested again by scientists. Those piils were making people lose weight so rapidly, increasing their chances of serious illnesses and diseases. Yes, it made them lose weight. However, it probably took a few years off of their lives. People don't necessarily buy those pills to be affected by them. By promoting those brands and pills, it gives people the idea that being thin is so important. It's so important that you need to take pills to lose it very fast. This is another example of the unrealistic beauty standards that are being forced on many people, mostly teenagers. They are made to believe that having a thin,  skinny body is what makes people beautiful. It could lead to multiple eating disorders. We should be more aware of the affect it has on us. In conclusion, we usually turn a blind eye to the negative affect society has on our mental health and self esteem just to convince ourselves that it's right to do this and support our favorite celebrities. We should also train ourselves  to not be affected by what we see so much. Not everything we see on social media is true. A person's social media account is basically just a highlight of their life, not all of it.
Social Media Social media is a platfrom that joins billions of people together and kill the thousands of miles seperating them from each other. In the 21st era, social media has become an important part of our lives. Some even gain their living off of social media. Although it seems like something positive, it can show a huge amount of negativity in our lives. Social media can be used as a lethal weapon or a helping hand. It all depends on the way people choose to use it. If your friend is studying away from home and thousands of miles are seperating you from each other, the only place where you will feel reconnected is most probably on social media platforms. You could open Skype, and suddenly all the distance is minimized and your friend is only one click away. You could see each other using the camera and hear each other and it would be like you've never been apart. Social media can also be used as a tool to spread awarness about any issue concerning the well-being of our world. Recently, social media platforms are  full with news about the fire in the Amazon forests. Using this simple tool, the whole world became engaged in a huge issue effecting our environment. We all put our hands together and did whatever we can to save our Earth. Some people filmed themselves while picking trash from the sea. Others started using steel straws for drinking, instead of using plastic straws and throwing them after. These are all positive ways to use social media. On the contrary, Social media can be used as a lethal weapon. It can be used to break up relationships between families or friends. On an early morning, a family gathers for breakfast on one table but there is not one laugh heard. This is because the parents are busy with their phones and the kids are scrolling down Instagram or chatting with their friends. Social media can also be used to hurt others or spread rumors about somone and ruin their image. Usually, teenagers are responsible for these kind of acts in what we call """Cyber" "Bullying""." Some kids expose their friends' secrets on social media platforms or start spreading rumors about them. At this stage of their lives, teenagers are affected by these things greatly. This act or behavior makes the person that is being bullied feel weak and helpless. This also affects how they do in class and may bring down their grades. Some kids even attempt suicied because they do not feel welcome into this world anymore. Social media has two completely different sides. It all depends on the way we choose to use it. We need to be careful while using social media platforms and try to spread postive energy while using them.
Social media are diffrent platforms you can access using the internet where indivuals can communicate with one another, share thier ideas and express thier opinion. In our modern day social media has become stormed our life and become one of the main source of communication between individuals. But how does it effect use as idividuals? Social media affect indviduals in both negative and positive ways. Social meda has made it easier for people to communicate with one another regardless  the distant between them. It made individuals more aware with what is happing aroung the world   from the people who are thier rather then hearing the news from the news. Social media can also be a safe space for people who feel like they are diffrent or an outcast, they can find people who they can identify with and can understand what they are going through. People wont feel alone. Where there are  alot of positive thing about social media there is the negative part of it. People become so consumed with social media that they forget to live in the moment, and they started to befrienf people online and communicate with them that they forget to communicate with the people around them, that why  alot of people  especial teenager  hasnt developed the basic skills of communcation with people because they reley on social media  alot. Another disadvantage od social media is that people become obsesed with apperancess because of the social media influncers who set false standered for teenager. More people became insecure with thier apperanse ans shallow rather than being concerne with thier personalities and the important thing in life
For the past 48 years the United Arab Emirates has developed a lot. Dubai was basically a dessert it had no structure, buildings, hospitals and mainly roads, but by time Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan  AlNahyan stepped in the community and changed this dessert into a stunning city this has made a big step in the UAE. Sheikh Zayed  AlNahyan always cared about gardening, he always used to ask the workers to plant palm trees and other plants just to make sure his country has a soul and  beautiful. Roads began to be structured, buildings strated to be built and the whole UAE has developed and proccessed to a better country. At the moment the UAE has developed a lot everything is available like jobs and more and now that Expo 2020 is next year it is a really big accomplishment that will be happening in the UAE and it will be held in Dubai, portraits of strength and courage will be assigned there and people from all around the world are going to be there. The country had put a lot of effort for this big exhibition and i am pretty sure it will be a big one.
How do social media affect indviduduals and society? Social media has had a huge impact in the world and not just the society we live in, everyone here has been affected by it. Over the past few years social media has changed significantly, it has been developed and put into good use. People have been using it to communicate with their families, friends, and humans in general from all over the world and they made it seem so efficient and easy. They are always advantages and disadvantages about everything, but social media is definetly something you should be careful of since everything can go wrong in seconds. You can publish a video of yourself or someone and it could go viral in minutes and there's no going back from it. You may get some hate or love it just depends on how  handle it. People have been affected by social media way too much that they commited sucide. You can get hate and love but you shouldn't let that get into you, you are way to important to end your life just because of someone who said some bad things to you and you are much stronger than them. Social media has became an essentail to people and it made theyr'e life so much easier and i am grateful to have the opportunity to see that change. You should focus more on the good and what makes you happy.
Social media sites offer the chance to share as well as create content. Through this content people could spread knowledge, experiences and just about anything. In our decade social media is a huge iconic phenomenon. Social media is advertised around the nation in countless ways. Social media affects our nation is many positive ways, as it is proven to assist in educating people. Through those social networking sites people are exposed to an abundant sum of information. One could simply learn about any matter through a quick click on their computer. It is the new normal in our society for every person to poses an account on those social media sites. Social media has powerful platform and is respected by the nations. Some people get their everyday news reports from social network sites such as twitter and reddit. Social media is also used to spread awarness about issues in society. It also gives individuals a platform to share their thoughts and beliefs. Social media can also have a negative affect on its users. Addiction is a serious affect caused by those social sites. Many people develop an absession with constantly updating their sites. Over time social media can take a negative toll on our economy and society. Many people can start working independently online, and  inturn cause a social decline in our society. Social media can also take a negative toll on our health. Excessive use of social networking sites can decline excersize time. Eye problems could develop after repetitavley spending long hours online. Although social media has its negative aspects the positives definitely outway them. Social media can be extremely beneficial if used modestly and properly.
Social Media and the world. Have you ever wonder around what are the affects of social media?  Everything in this world is two faced, social media is considered one of the most powerful weapons that may be used in a good way or another. In this essay i am going to discuss the affects of social media on individuals and society  used in a good way. Social media is considered one of the best developments that has ever happened in this universe. Society is much closer than ever before, the whole world is like a small village thanks for social media. You dont have to seek for news about the outer world, news comes to you with just one click on your electronic device. Society has been very connected because of social media, also individals are the main part of any society, so whenever individuals are connected, society will be even more bound with a strong relation. Furthermofre, social media is so helpful for individuals who lives far away from home, or have relatives  dosent live nearby, and   so many situation that social media may be more than useul. In the past, people spent weeks and months waiting for a respond of a massage from someone just a cople of kilometers away. However, nowadays a message is been sent and recieved in less than a secound from people miles away. As i mention social media is a blessed invention. It kept people connected with  eachother and eyes opened about what is happening in the world. Use it wisely and the society will always remain bound with a strong relation.
Social media can affect individuals and society in many ways. Individuals now a days depend on social media in many ways to the point where they believe everything on social media which affects their life, in other words social media has a negative impact on individuals such as teenagers, teenagers use social media as a place to bully other individuals, in my opinion thats a major affect from social media. How can social media affect the society, the society can use social media to raise awarness for problems that the society has which can also be held by teenagers because they tend to be on social media most of the time doing nothing at least they can have meet, people tend to meet on social media and not  out trying to help the society in someway,  social media can be a great thing for the society only if it was used in the right way, nevertheless social media can be a great plat form for advertising, individuals in the society can premote their work on such a great plat form that can reach all over the world, In conclusion, social media does affect individuals and the society in positive and negative ways, either ways people should try and use social media in the right way and not drift to the bad ways.
How do you communicate with your family and friends? By sending a handwritten letter and wait 3 days for the reply? May I also ask you how do you get to know the daily news? Is it by reading the newspapers witha  cup of coffee every morning? Well, both of us know the answers to these questions and it's through social media. Social media has developed  enormous number of users, but it has its positive and negative affects on indivisuals and society as well. The social media has become used by indivisuals all around the world, which I can say it had made life much easier. Do you remember the first question I asked about how do you communicate with other people? Social media had made it easier to keep in touch where you can say hi just by clicking the send button on your phone and he/she can reply the same way or by starting a video call! thats amazing right? Moreover, you are able to read the news online and know people's opinions about it. Also, if you're too lazy to check the news everyday,  you can just subscribe to any newspaper you like and get notifications about what's happening now. The intensive use of social media nowadays doesnt mean that it doesnt have a negative side. One of these effects can be social isolation where you no longer communicate with people face-to-face,   but instead prefer to chat online. this may cause several mental illnesses such as anxiety, and depression. People of the society will no longer have  strong connection as before. for example, family members will be isolated each in his/her room. They may only see each other once in a day on the dinner table. and this really affects the bond between them. Social media has a huge impact on our lives and affected it in both  positive and  negative way. personally, i think the negative effects are more than the positive ones.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has various affects on individuals and society that are both positive and negative. Although the word """social""" is in the title, interactions between people have been occurring digitially, meaning face to face interactions are lost. People have become drawn to their phones, as if they are addicted to them, thus makng them antisocial. Social media is a good place to allow self expression, for example, Instagram is a platform that allows users the freedom to post pictures of their lives and edit them using their desired filters and editing it in their own way. Over time, people have grown creatively as they take inspiration from other instagrammers and use it themselves. Social meda has also provided job opportunities by sponsoring social influencers to promote products to their followers. However, this comes with the negative backlash from some people which creates pressure for the influencer as they feel like an expectation has been set that they did not reach. This also translates to society whereby social media creates standards of women for example. On social platforms women are presented as skinny, tall, and beautiful. Society then takes these conventons of women and pressures girls about what is expected from them and when they can't meet those expectations they are overwhelmed by feelings of insecurity and sadness which leads to mental illnesses and eating disorders. On the other hand, these typical beauty conventions that social meda displays has also led to the formation of a new society that rebels  these expectations and teach women that it is okay not to follow the rules of beauty because everyone is beatiful in their own way.

Social media effcted many peoples lifes adults may use the media in a good and in a usefull way but other genratios might  use it in not a usefull way like kids and teens they might be tricked by others , they can even be kidnapped through social media by older people ,but we can use social media in many usefull ways too . we use social media in most of our times to communicate with others and our familys , we learn new things and learn about other countries from social media . social media effects every person indivualy , it could make someones life better but others people might be misreble becouse of social media because  oher peopls comments and  bad news that they see on social media would effect there lives , in the society social media made other lifes better cause it made peoples lives easier and its easier to commiunicate with our beloved ones . In a way social media can be helpfull and makes our lives better but it can be also not very helpfull. Social media have changed the wolrd to  batter place and made our lives so much easier but we have to make sure that we use social media in the right way and in a usefull way and make sure to tech the others to use social media in the right way.
Social media has a very big affect on the society, it can be unrealistic information or information that is not accurate  it change's people's minds in many different ways. Many people do not approve of using social media as it has a very negative side as well as it may   contain many toxic and unrealistic information.Therefore  social media can have a great impact on people as you may learn many different things and develop your mind set,it should be restricted for young people as it may include bad content.As  we all know social media nowadays is very popular in many types of categories,for  example if you want to learn about any specific thing it will appear easily.The  society may change unfortunatly as many individuals come up with rumors or bad decisions that many other people learn from social media, i think that people under the age of 15 shouldn't be using social media because they may attach a very bad habit on them as this generation doesn't have a good image.A  lot of children use social media now.I  think that the society should make social media a secure and safe place for people to go online and should be restricted for younger poeple or their parents should be watching cause you cant trust a child on social media.Finally as many people agree that there should be a lot of changes made to make it a safe and secure place.
Social Media and how it affects Individuals and Society Social Media is a platform that almost every individual uses, whether you're a teenager, or an adult, we all use it. Twitter, Skype, Snapchat and Instagram are some examples of social media, but what affect does it have on us individuals? What makes us 'addicted' to our phones to the point where we have to check it so often? People are always looking for ways to comminicate with each other, nowadays barely anyone has the time to meet up with friends or family and they use an alternative such as Skype, a video calling chat which allows us individuals to comminicate with others via tablet or smartphone. I believe that people don't see the importance of 'get togethers' or gatherings which is the main thing that helps us bond with each other. Every day a new social media app becomes popular and everyday  we draw ourselves away from the idea that it will make us check our phones more often and it could lead to a lot of negative outcomes to our daily life.
Social media has a huge impact on societies in both  positive and  negative way. First, the positive effects. Social media can be a great way of communication and allow you to contact and stay in touch with long distance friendships you can also be updated with the news and new trends not only news but also  a way of learning and getting knowladge as well as following people you love such as authors, influencers and more. Somehow, social media can be usefull for enterpreneurs and business because you can have advirtisment for free. on the other hand, social media can have a negative influence on people and societies. By spreading rumors and fake news. social media can take you away from your family and friends because we no longer have face to face chats and gatherings instead we just send a text message or a call to ask about our beloved ones. It can also take you away from your hobbies and interests because nowdays people spend their free time scrolling down time lines and watching posts and videos all over social media applications instead of reading a book, painting or any other hobby. Afterall,  we can choose how we can be effected by social media. If we used it in a good way it will have a good and positive influence and if we misused it it will effect us in a negative way.
Today soacial media is one of the most intresting ways to comunicate with others, and it save a long time and distance to send a messages or a photo  even a voice messages, but it has effects and it can come positivily or negativily it depends on the your ways of using it, in the positive ways as we said before it saves your time instead of sending letters and waiting for a months to get the responde and wait more extra months to reseave the letter from the sender, you can even start your business from your house in your room starting from zero, and it dosen't mean that the social media is 100% save and good, it can affect you negativily and ruin your life, the normal average to use it is 2 hours in a day but some people espesially teenagers use their phone up to 6-8 hours in a day and this is absloutly a bad usage, parents should keep their eyes on their childrens and they ahve to know what their kids are doing and    texting who,because they could have phsycho essiues and it could effect their feelings, and they could lose their childrens for that, finally you have to know how to use social media in  good way to provid getting in troubles
Nowadays evryone has a finger print in  internet by social media, social media can change lives, personality and mentality. it can be a good or a bad thing  by how do you use it. Social media is an important resourse to be open to the world, to know more than others and to communicate with them. it makes lives easier,  can help to develope the countries,  know new cultures out others countries and to share knowladges. but if you used the social media in a bad way it can effect you and your community in the same way. If every person take there responsibilty to use  internet and social media in a good way. they will decrease the cyberbullying, share unethical things and ejaculation. they will get a good idea about the community and the culture. the social media life have a many impact in the person menality,  can make u feel down,  happy and feel less about yourself. cause evrything in social media is perfect. although social media can be a waste of time, it can make you waste all of your time by doing nothing  only watching celebrties or some TV shows. countries and self development  build in  internet and social media, so eveyone should take their responsibilty and use it carefully.
Social media is really important nowadays and everyone is using it . Social media will help the society in diffrent ways positive and also negative. Social media can be positive and helpful because you can stay in touch with family and friends,  you can find and interact with new people who may have the same interests as you, finding news are easier with social media and the best thing is social media is a free platform. Positive social media will help the society to stay together and be strong without any issues. But the disadvantages or the negative side of social media is popular nowadays, my first example is bullying it is now a huge issue in our society because people have access into others people lifes, social media can be used by terrorist on the highly extreme side and it can also distract you from your studies, social media can give you a fake live that you apper by it in front of your followers. i can see that nowadays the negative side of social media is more and it is affecting the society. in my openion social media can be helpful and you can have fun using it if you interact with it in a positive way.
How do social media affect individuals and society... Social Media has become one of the most dependent resources in life. The effect of Social Media on society has increased in the last couple of years. What is social media? Social media consists of applications that help you connect with others, share pictures with them, and even more. Social Media has become a huge part of our lives, and some people cant go one day without using it. Social Media has effected society in good ways and bad ways. Many adults, teenagers, and kids have become addicted to life on social media to the point where they can't go hours without using their phones. Some people have also become emotionless while using social media; for example if someone doesn't like the other they immediately block them. The worst affect Social Media has on society is that it distracts people about whats happening around them in the present time. Generations are becoming more dependent on technology and social media that they forget to live their own life. Although Social Media has great negative effects on society it also has many positive advantages for example; communication has become easier in so many ways with applications like whatsapp, twitter, and skype. Another advantage is that social media has become a big part for the business industry because a lot of businesses use instagram or snapchat to promote their new products, or services and  costs you less then promoting your business on a billboard or on tv. In conclusion Social Media has affected society in so many different ways. I trust that social media has its advantages but also is a great distraction from the real world, and I believe people should control the time they spend on it.
Social Media can affect individuals and the society in different ways. Addiction is a huge problem along many teenagers and young adults as they spend most of their time using different applications to engage and communicate with friends or even new people all around the world. Applications  many of us use on a daily basis like Snapchat, Instagram and twitter are a very easy and effective way to quickly communicate with others however every individuals time should be managed and you can easily do that in the settings of any iphone by controlling how many hours you'd want to spend on social media. That makes a positive impact on our society as well as individuals as they wouldn't be as attached to their devices and would make some time for other activities and hobbies in their daily routines. By doing this there is a bigger chance that young adults would focus more on their studies and work making them achieve a successful future for themselves. In contrast, There are many positive points on social Media as it can be used for studying and teaching purposes or even as a place for advertising many small bussiness of various Emirati's who would like to expand their businesses. Social Media can benefit us only if we use it properly and manage our time with it so that it does not distract us from building a great future for ourselves.

Nowadays, people use technology in every part in there lives. We use social media to connect with people all over the world, and read the latest news and updates that happen in every second.It  affects our lives a lot and that can be positively or negatively. Social media helps people connect and communicate easily now, so you can talk to your family and friends wherever you are and whenever you want.On  the other hand , It can harm your physical and mental health , using your phones and laptops for a long period of time can harm your eyes , your joints , and your mental health in general.

Social media is  different kind of apps that you can download it in your phones or any tablet . In my opinion social media has a huge impact in both individuals and society.  Ifcourse like any other thing their is the postive side and  negative side of social media . Social media has great benfits for the both individual and society. It help indiviuals in many ways if they use it correctly. It introduced to them to new information , it helped them think outside the box  ,be more social with the people around them , it also helped the meet new people.

For the negative side for the inviduals is that bullying can happen easily , and the lack of self confidense . And for the society it spread more haitness , and the biggest negative side is that people spend lots of time in social media wich lets them forget about the world around us , Espically for parents and kids social media can realkly affect them in a negative way if they didmt use it correctly.

How do social media affect individuals and society? Teenagers and Millennials nowadays are addicted to their phones and i think that it affects their social life. It affect them in a sence that some people get bulied and it affects them negtively. and it leads to social annxity. because they see everyones life on social media living """perfect" "lifes""" although its all edited and selected. so people get jelouse and start evining people so they try to blame other people for it even though its no ones falut. social media affects the socity because it makes people addicted to their phones and it doesn't let people socialize and it turns us to antisocial creates that dont know how to comunate with others and it is a negative affect. But it can also benfit the society. it can help raise awaerness about our society. For example it helped raise arweaness about the amzoon forest being caught on fire and forced people to talk about it. some people helped set up foundraises. Also because of social media people are more awear of pollotion and now teenagers are tring to prevent pollotin by using less plastic and making less waste. To councloude social media has both negative and positive affect on our society.
In my opinon  think socail media has been the most importent thing to everyone. Everyone uses it in the whole part of the earth. It also has a lot of benefits in it, for example knowing about the news and how everything is going on and its also esair for everyone because people had to get out to buy some newspapers and it takes a lot of time and probebly half of the pepole were lazy. What is also good about it is the you also can know news about from the other countries yes it also can be at the news paper but maybe they take few days to write it down and from your phone or laptop you can know  in just one seconed. One of the best benefits of gthe social media is the your can call people from different countries and thagt really good and helpful.  Best part of that is you can do 
Social media affect individuals and society in many different ways.It  affects individuals by either making them interseted in a good way or a bad way. In a bad way it may distract you for what you need to do or make you do something for example these days a person can get influces by an influncers, that will caujse promblems because maybe they cant afford something or they are benfiting of them and it will even cause problems in the society its just because they influces people lives and making them do things and other can benfit them.in  a good way they can learn things they never thought on finding and they can share experince   either its coming from an indiviual or a group of people at the end they both impact on each  other.Nowadays everyone  either youre too young for social media or too old  theyre all affected by it. how does it affect?it  affec t by leting the media control youre life , making  decision thats not sutible for you, benitfing from it and mostly causing problem either mentally or physically.People  are just showing off these days and making other people jealous and  be negative in life social media these days are just showing off what you have and getting money  thats my opinion.
Social media has a huge affect on the society in my opinion. Nowadays people use social media mostly every single day, its been a routine in their day. Social media is mostly  a postive affect than a negative one, people get to talk to their loved ones that are far from them,  get to know new people, and news get to spread faster and easier. But mostly society sees social media as a big negative affect on kids and teenagers. Kids get affected easily from what they see in the internet, its mostly because their parents don't teach them what's good for them and what's not and what kind of strangers to beware of them. What's good in the internet is that parents could use parent control in their child's phone to see what their doing. Nowadays we have influencers in our socail media's, social media is kinda their job what they do is that they promote stuff so people get to buy it and they make money out of it. Some influencers have a negative affect on individuals, they bulid insecurities on their viewers which is half of the society, they lose their self-love in them and many more. In my opinion some people see that as a negative affect and some don't, but i see it as a postive affect in the world.
Social media has been an important part of our life nowadays, it has it's negative and positive effects on individuals depending on how we all use it. However, it also effects the society and how people are communicating with eachother  and that changes how we communicated before and in our recent days. Social media plays a big role in some people's life, specially at this generation  a lot of people depend on technologies. Communicating with our friends became easier thanks to social medias, most of us agree that it is easier to share your interests in the internet and people who have similiar interests will interact with you since it is easier to find someone who share the same interests in social media than in real life. Furthurmore, I also think that people with social anxiety or any social problems, have more chance to get to know people through social media as a first step to be interactive, because for them it is hard to communicate with other beings face to face. As I mentioned above, social media can affect individuals in a negative way too depending on how you use it, one of the most common negative impact about social media is ''Cyber-bullying''. Some people get quite comfortable with their friends in social media that they post anything in it, however not everyone reacts positively to the things that people post, some will criticise in a bad way that will put the other person in a bad situation that   the individual could lead to thinking of commiting suicide, and that affects our society in many ways. In summary, social media has helped our life in  way by making communicating with our friends and family easier, but it does have it's bad ways of affecting people in our society, we have ways to prevent it and society is trying it's best to avoid making it more horrible.
As long as there is a new generation always coming up with something new, the influence must be from social media. Theres something always positive and negative about social media since it affected  alot of people in a good and bad way.  Having people of all ages  use social media whether to socialize and communicate, to be other people idols or to help support other influencers. However,  majority of the society doesnt use social media and think that it always have a bad influence on the younger generation. Having so many people against using social media makes the society argue about whether it has a good influence on their kids and some think that with their kids being able to talk and communicate to people from all around the world and the idea of that makes them scared and maybe  even try convincing people to stop using social media, for example there is people who use social media to bully otheres and might even drive them to suicide which can cause big issues in the society. On the other hand, there is so many positive things about social media such as people being able to sell homemade products from scratch with such cheap prices and maybe even free delivary and good offers, there is people using sociakl media to learn new languages and help others learn.
In this century ,the social media has a big impact on us as an individuals and socities and changed the human beings a lot from what we were before,the  social media has some advantages and disadvantages . First of all , the social media makes people communicate all around the world and makes the world a smaller places by keeping all the socities close to each other and   easy to communicate with each others, some examples of the social media applications is instagram , snapchat and youtube . offcourse every thing has advantages and disadvantages so lets discuss social media advantages and disadvantages , the first advantage of the social media is that it helps you make new friends and it helps you keep in touch with your friends , colleeges and people you want to talk to . another advantage is that it makes you open to the world and know what is happening around the world just by opening your phone . The social media also has disadvantages , firstly social media keeps a gap between family members and that is something  should not happen between family members , and most criminals use social media as a way to reach or trap their preys . In conclusion , the social media is a good way to contact the world but also we should be aware from its consequences .
Socail media is very important in our generation because know everything works in smart devices and some people conatcts others using through social media like snapchat, but sometimes social media efects society because of how people uses socail media like spreding romers or using it to make other fall in a bad situation. Social media helped  alot of people in many stuff like   poeple who works in a small business it helps them to spread their work, some started to work in social media like models or help people who  got a huge bussiness to spread it around the world but by paying them and this got bigger now, some people uses social media and affect kids by thier way in speaking or personalities thats why everyone should use social media in a way that dosent make kids get a bad personality and behavior. Some people thinks that social media is bad to use because of some of its bad affects and how it makes thier children ignore thier homeworks  because of what people spread  and make them think about things that does not help them with thier school work or their life. Social media made some people happy because of how it helped them with the work or business they do and some did not because it affected thier life in a negtive way so people should use it  a good way and make them think in a positive way.
Social media affects individuals and socities greatly, whether that be in a negative or a positive way. This is due to the the prevelance and signifcance of social media in our daily lives; most people would say that social media is almost replacing major newspaper companies which is evidenced by companies shift into the digital age with known newspapers such as The Telegraph becoming available on popular social media such as Snapchat. In this way, social media has a vast affect amongst people of all demographics, especially young adults. As well as spreading global news, social media is effective in joining communties together and creating subcultures - it can be used to communicate with family memebers and friends as well as strangers with similar intrests and lifestyles. Moreover, social media has made an abundance of possiblties more realistic and tangible as it can also be used in an educational way. Platforms such as Youtube have many educational resources which have personally helped me throughout  highschool with subjects ranging from history to chemisty, there were also instances  teachers would use these videos in class to help explain a concept in a easy and simplifed way. For this reason it is hard to deny that social media has a great impact on us as a society.
Social media is a worldwide element that mostly everyone having access to it, use. Social media can be a source of distruction to an individual and society, but could also be a point of improvement and inspiration. It all comes down to the way one chooses to use it and how much you let the content affect you. If used improperly, people's lives could be affected. The expectations that society has put up for individuals  ranging from  status, to how you should look like,  has brought a robotic-like living to our world. With those expectations being brought up, some individuals have made it their life goals to reach them leaving their skills and their talents on hold. With that what one could've invented and improved is lost and society moves hopelessly to the future. Those expectations have also rose the percentage of depression, as he fact that each person is unique in their own way and that there is no uniform to what makes a person great and exceptional, has not been accepted.
Social media plays an important role in our society. Social media has changed our lives in many different ways. Most people use social media as a way of communicating with others. Its effects not only individuals as well as the society itself. Nowadays technology has enhanced the way of communication . People don't tend to talk face-to-face   anymore.In  addition, individuals started using social media as a way of showing their happiness or sadnesess. Social media can affect the person both physically and mentally. For instance, social media can be a way to track sports news and may lead the person to be physically helathy. However, social media can also affect a person mentally. It can lead to depression , anexiety or even sucidal thoughts. The society itself can be destructed by social media. It can spread hateness among people in the society. Social media does affect the way a society would work and represent itself between other communities. It can either bring them closer toward a strong community or pull them down toward a weak community. Most importantly social media have had an affective way of upgrading the community and an individual's mentality towards many objects. The world wouldn't be what it is without social media.
a) Tolerance,  one of the most important things that are needed for a society to function properly. Without tolerance, we wouldnt be where we are today the melting pot of cultures that come together and coexist as one. The United Arab Emirates is a country that is known for its tolerance and acceptence, to further emphasise this, the year 2019 has been named the year of tolerance by the ruler of the UAE. What a ideal way to promote tolerance in the country when the world around us is falling to its feet, when racism has become the new fashion and when the number of hate crimes has risen in the most developed countries in the world. We as a country cannot stress enough the importance of tolerance in our daily lives, we even have a minister of tolerence that goes to lengths to satisfy the needs of the many religions and nationalities in our country as they too are a crucial pillar in society. The UAE is already doing a great job in promoting tolerance in the country as it is instilled in us, taught in our schools and shown to us on a daily basis. I am very fortunate to live in a country that goes  lengths to ensure the happiness of its residence regardless of age, gender, religion or ethnicity.
In the 21st centuary, social media is a major influence on people's minds. All our lives evolve around how famous or how active we are on these tools and we have no choice but to be a follower to these brainwashers. Social media have many benefits and withdrawls but it all depends on how the person uses it. One important benefit includes how easy it's  to reach out for everyone. Technology have made our lives easier and we are able to travel the world while laying down on our comfy beds. Important and useful messages can be heard by everyone and by that, we can help spread peace and have a huge influence on people's opinions. On the other hand, as well as useful messages, famous influencers on social media could misuse this advantage and use it for their own benefit. They could spread unappropriate material that could create a bad influence on the young, uneducated generations. In my opinion, social media has created a huge impact on individuals and the society because people are so easily affected by influencers and their unhealthy life styles leading to them being taken as role models. The damage is already created and all that parents could do right now is educate their children on the right way to use these social media.
Social media has a major affect on our lives. There is a variorty  sources we could communicate with family and friends  for example snapchat, instagram, twitter and facebook. Having those kinds of social media can help develop the society but it can harm our society as well. Social media has its advantages and disadvantages and I will start with the disadvantages. Social media has to be used in the right way or else it will harm our society. A distadvantage is bullying or blackmailing. There is numours amount of people each year commit suicide because of bullying. People threaten them or spread rumors about him which can lead to suicide because they loose their confidence in themselves. In my opinion, social media has to have some sort of protection just to help  people from commiting suicide and help them solve their issues online. Now, i will start talking about the advantages of social media. social media opens a wide place for busnisses such as marketing and trasportation. It helps people to sell their items online through google and transport it in and outside the country by aramex or dhl which is the most commen apps used to transport products. Another advantage is communication, you can communicate with yours friends and family by whatsup and you can send pictures and videos so that they can check how you are doing in life  or just have fun together. By using social media you can easily find friends you can relate to and text them so that you can seek some advice from them.
Social media plays a big role in our daily lives today. People spend most of their time on social media to the point where it has decreased the time people use to communicate with people in real life. This impacts both individuals and the society. Although social media has many disadvantages, it has some advantages and one of them is that it combines all types of media into one platform. People are now more aware of what goes on around the world, this is because they can easily check the news from these applications without having to wait for it to be shown on newspapers and  television. Some people also use it to create and start their business which often leads to using it as a form of advertising. Another advantage is that, communicating with people around the world has become more accessible and easy. They can socialize with friends and family without having to meet them in person and that has disadvantages. People now talk to each other more using social media applications rather than in person, this affects their speaking and communication skills, this also has an effect on their language which affects us as a society.
The internet have brought us with developments enhancing the ways of communication. Social media, including instagram, twitter and snapchat, have spread its popularity worldwide. Not a single day passes were people don,t browse their social media pages. Nowadays everyone knows what the other is doing even when they are miles apart with just a single click. People have become more shallow over the years as the use of social media increased drasticly. Individuals seem to care more about their apperances so the pictures they would take and upload on social media for others to see, would be well precieded. Their lives have no longer become spontanous and humble. There are times when they would rehearse a scene a couple of times just for it to be perfect for others to watch on their social media page in awe. Owning the fanciest cars or bags have become a priority to many individuals. Those that follow such standards are the most followed on social media pages and are recieved with likes on their posts. Society have developed social pressure on individuals to always look a certain way and dress or act in a certain manner. It is liked they are caged in  world were they live for others. Everyone uses social media extensively and most of them don't get much use out of it. At all times whether they are at work, university, home or right before they sleep, people check their phones and open social media. As a society it would be more beneficial for individuals if they would back off social media a bit and not make it the ceneter of their attention.
c) Social media plays a massive role in shaping individuals in our society. Back in the day, social media was either non existent or not very common; people were very social and engaged in everyday activities and kept eachother  company. However, now people all around the world of all ages participate in social media. This can be both good and bad. For example, social media allows people to access infromation faster than ever before and allows  global connection for business. Social media has a downside as it makes people less social, it can be addictive. People will decide to stay in their rooms to surf the web and go on many variety of apps instead of going out and meeting new people. This negatively affects our society. Social media is a very good concept if you use it wisley, if you do it will make an idividual smarter and  can create frienships around the world. Although if it is used in a bad way or if it does get to a point where it is getting addictive it will half a bad impact on the individual as it is pulling them away from the reality of life and detaches them from society.
Social media is a very important thing in our lives. However 100 years ago people didn't really used it, They used to communicate with each other physically .a society changed after the Technology developed in good and bad ways. although this change have changed how # lifestyle used to be but it's still better than not changing at all right? It's right that we don't communicate Face to face that much but it's not always a Nigative thing. In my opinion I thank that sometimes it better to talk to people by phone than talking to them personally. we have to addmit that sometime we don't laugh out loud when our friend tell a joke but still we can preted  we  are on thats so they dont be sad. Social media hadn't only affected communications It even affectes our physicallife  too. I think it's such a bad thing that people stay all night watching netxx instead of sleeping.  texting their friend or even posting in instagram instead of working out. Not only  it affected the socity if also affected our own lives too sometimes people doesn't sleep at night and when they wake up they got more and they don't talk to people, so after that they want get a social life and at the end of the day they get depressed and that affect the mentalhealth  of a person. In concludion social life could affect every body only you choose wether you want a positive change or a negative change.
Social media has become the biggest platform that people use for many reasons. Some like to escape reality by creating a safe space for themselves, and others can make an actual living out of posting advertisments, as well as gaining a huge following. It isn't a secret that our world is being built around social media. This means it must have a huge influence on not just individuals, but our society too. The affect it has can be either positive or negative depending on how you look at it. The way I see it is that a lot of job opportunities are being offered to people with a huge following. Let's say for example a person has a million followers on Instagram, he/she can make thousands of dollars by just posting one advertisment for a certain company. Another positive affect social media has is that it makes spreading news or awareness very easy. For example, climate change has been the hot topic on many social media platforms as awareness about it is spreading fast. I think that it's things like this that makes me glad our world has social media. However, we must not ignore all the negative and dangerous outcomes from using social media too much, such as privacy invasion, depression, lack of communication, and many more. I believe if we are careful with our usage with social media, it wouldn't do us much harm.
social media is one of the most important haunts on the internet;social  media offer to people to reconnect with there old friends and make new friends and it can helps us to study online  take courses and we can use it to for help it has a big effect on everyone now adays there is not a single person without snapchat,instagram  ,twitter....etc  people use there phone to communicate  then to visit them or talk in person these days there is no child or grown up without a smartphone more over;there is positive sides and negative sides unfortunetly there is cyber bullying and online harassment if your not very careful some people tend to pick on people just for some fun reasons on the internet there is also an impact on privacy if we are not careful  what we post on the internet it can come back and hunt  you.revealing personal information is bad because exmple photos and videos...they  can take it and blackmail you and all  this andif  you open your location some may stalk youin  conclusion social media has its advanages and disadvantages,its  up to each person how to use social media wisely to enchance there personal and social life.
C) In modern society, social media is inevitably a very important part of our daily lives. Almost everybody in every part of the wolrd has some form of social media, it can be used for personal uses but can also be used in some work places. It is a great tool for keeping families who live in different parts of the world connected or spreading news and raising awareness about important issues. However, along with in benefits and undeniable advantages that socail media has provided there are some negative consequences that also come with the widespread use of social media. Many celebrities are on socail media and obviously have a huge number of followings. They show their extravagant and seemingly perfect lives to the public, this can have quite the impact on nornal people causing them to compare themselves to these poeple and wonder why they can not have  perfect body or expensive car and this can sometimes sadly lead to peoople - the younger generation especially - to develop unhealthy eating habits or a lifestly to try and achieve what they are seeing on socail media. Another issue that is caused by social media is cyber bullying. Social media has made it incredibly easy to bully a person online and this can have devestating results on the person on the recieveing end and this can cause distrust and hatred to fester within a community. That being said i personally think that if we all use social media tp spread positivity and use it to raise awarness to pressing issues then it could do the world a favour.
C) Social media is a great way in which the world communicates today, it encourages globalisation and promotes communication between people no matter where they are in the world. It also helped society evolve at a faster rate and many benefits come along with this such as being more aware and understanding cultures at a deeper level then one would normally.  Before the internet and social media communicating with people who where far away took days - if not weeks. The telegram was one of the inventions developed in the late 18th century that helped inspire receiving important messages fast which in turn resulted  talking to someone only requiring the push of a button in nowadays. However with benefits also comes disadvantages; the media is a poweful assest that contributes to peoples perception of certain topics and although some of the information on social media might be false or incorrect it changes peoples opinions and many are manipulated by  mass media. Furthermore social media presents unrealistic goals of how people should look and lead their lives which may affect an indvidual negatively as people can spread hate easily due to the fact that they can hide behind a screen which can result in depression, anxiety and many more issues.
Social media is a very controversial subject nowdays. first of all what is social media exactly? social media is an online web or app that people use to connect with others and post pictures and videos. people of most age groups use social media, starting from 10 year olds up to adults. Social media has its positive and negative effects on individuals and society. To begin with, social media has its most effect on younger age groups, such as teenagers and young adults mostly, since they are the most vulnerable.   The most effect it has is on the younger age group,and  it is mostly negative, because younger people tend to follow big influencers and as a normal human being those people would want to own the things that celebrities own, they want to have the same body, face shape,  nose of that celebrity, which lowers the younger group self confidence, and causes depression in some cases. On the other hand, older age groups usually arent effected by influnecers and celebrities, because they are older and wiser in other words they know better. As in the effect of social media on society as a whole, it definitely has opened the people's minds,  raised awareness about many things, yet it still has a bad infulence on younger people within the society.
How many of you are addicted to social media and can't go a day without being on soacial media? Social media now a days has a huge impact on our life. It has taken over the world, It has it's negatives and positives in our society. First of all, Social media may affect individuals but not as much as it affects our society, people are getting addicted in bad ways which is affecting their personal life such as, their families and their work life. Although social media has lots of positives; like communicating has been so much easier. People are relying on social media on a lot of things. second,it  has huge negatives on our society, There are people that are using social media in a wrong way especially that social media is open around the world, and has no control. So such bad users can represent the society in a bad way. And a research showed that people are mostly using social media in their work time which affects the sociaty in different ways. In conclusion, People should watch out on their selfes when using social media and be more careful about it, And  have to know how  control between their life and being on social media.
Social Media Social media is a big part in each one individuals, by one touch you can change so much. by social media coming in to our lives there are the pros and cons. some of the pros are where you can help people over seas and also learn over social media its such a power full thing you can do so many things, where some of the cons are  maybe people are at war and they are using social meadia in some apps  you can track that persone and that can effect a disaster, a persone can pretand to be someone else in social media and so many other things. we cant denay that socail media helped us and devolepet so much  such insted of going and buying books you can downlode it in your phone, you can facetime your friends that lives  long way from you and also use social media to learn and educate your self. By one click you can either devolbe something usefull or destroy something, In my opinion i think everybody that are using social media should be carefull and not but there whoule life out there in social media and people should use it the right way. overall social media is such an amazing thhing that happend to us that makes life so much easier in someway. 
Social media affects individuals and the society in  alot of different ways that can be negative or positive. The positive things that social media can do is  make us smarter like for example we can find anything we want online. you can search about anything you want to learn about like science , math, english and anyhting you can think of. Social media also helps us to see what is going on in the word like in sports , government and any type of news you would like to know about. Social media also helps us to comunicate with our friends and family any where in the world. Which really helps if your missing anyone like for example if your mum is away, you can use social media to talk to her and that helps  alot. However if we dont use social media wisely and carefuly it can have  alot of negative affects in the society.  Alot of cyber bullying happens in social media because some people find it as an easy way to target someone and send them cruel messages. Another bad thing is that people can become very addicted to their phone to use social media especialy teenagers which affects them in their real social life. It can also affect them in a negative way in their school life because their brain will want to think about social media and when will the lesson  finish so they could go straight away to their phones. In my opinion I think social media has a balance between positive and negative and it can be more of a postive thing if we use it properly like make time for everything and balance your social media life and your normal life.
The UAE is one of the most countries that  uses technology and artificial intellegince a lot. This is very important for the level of the country especially from the economic side. Nowadays, the most important development in the UAE is using artificial intellegince in everything. Artificial intellegince is really important for the future and it is connected to all jobs. Most students study this major when they join the university. However, this major needs a lot of hard work because it is related to engineering and technology. On the other hand, I joined Zayed University and this university does not have this major but I am sure that after  few years all the universities in the UAE will include  artificial intellegince major. Artificial intellegince can develop our knowledge and skills which improve our future.
How do social media affect individuals and society Social media is something everyone use,  parents, teenagers, grandparents and also children, there are many ways to use social media,  some advertise and some view the advertisment, there are advantages and disadvantages to using social media. There are several advantages for using social media, fashionistas advertise for some companies and get paid for the advertisment, parents will keep on track on what's happening in the society, teenagers might follow a bussiness man and learn how to invest and start a bussiness from them,  kids learn a lot of stuff, nowadsys kids know more than most of us teenagers because they learn in a fun way by spending time on social media. Let's not forget about the disadvantages, some teenagers use social media in  wrong way by watching inapropriate videos, talking to strangers and giving them information they're not suppose to know, and even bully others online. kids might spend all their time on social media instead of spending most of their time playing outside with their friends or doing somethig creative,  maybe learing to cook and bake. We have to try and prevent others and ourselves from using the social media in a wrong way, parents should spend more time with their kids to tell them what'a wrong and what's right, and to ask them about what they do on social media  who they follow.
(C) These past few years have been a huge advantage for technology since they are the years  that technology has changed and developed, and one of these developments that came from technology was Social media. Social media have been here since the start of  21st century therefore  the beginning of a new era. There are many ways Social meida could effect individuals as well as a society,  could be advantages and diadvantages. Many people may consider social media as a good way of expressing yourself and your beliefs but others see how it could effect people to have a extreme high standard of living a lifestyle that they cant afford or is not for them. Therefore people could get affected by social media in a way thats unhealthy and  could actually mentally damage them, for example the beauty standard thats aiming towards teenage girls that they should always look representable, thin, and beautiful could lead to mental illness like anorexia, bulimia and depression because they could never be  the pictures of the girls that are  social media. There are also many advantages to social media where people could actually voice their beliefs and opinions rather than being scilenced,   could be politically, comedically or even just talking about your day and expressing your emotions. Its a good way of venting to other people, or just putting it out there. social media is also greta for raising awareness and letting people know whats going on in the world, for example the climate change thats been happening and the near extinction of turtles because of plastic which by raising awareness in social media it decreased the use of plastic straws. Which made society and the individuals aware of their surroundings rather than living in their own little bubble. In conclusion social media has its advantages and disadvantages on society and in individuals.
Nowadays people consider social media their most truested form, and see what's trending on these sites to spread information, but these people don't realize how social media ruined our view of life. People nowadays believe everything they see on social media sites, and that helped a lot of people start or bring back their careers, but also ruined a lot of others who people pointed at with false accusations. People stopped relying on TV, and newspaper to get informtion, as they started using social media, since it is a much faster platform, and because they don't have to search because news get trended easily, and people can check the latest updates, however the platform that trends news immedietly ruined  lives of a lot of people, and an example of that is a chinese model, which did a photoshoot without knowing what the company advertised, and only found out after seeing the poster of her with a guy and children which were supposedly unattractive, implying that the parents got  plastic surgery, and that's why their children didn't look attractive, but after that the chinese model trended of something she was falsely accused of, which stopped her career completly, as companies didn't want to hire someone with a bad reputation. Although the public didn't do anything more than write hateful comments towards her, the model's career got ruined because of  media play, and because people believed things before making sure  what they're spreading is true.
Social media has a huge impact in a person's life and the society, whether it was positive or negative. As an individual, it is your choice on how you'd like to use it. For example, if you spend a lot of time on social media, you are basically spending your day on your phone, laptop, etc, when instead you could be doing something else, like hanging out with your friends and family, reading a book, or even helping out. What you choose to post,  who you choose to follow, could impact you mentally. If you choose to follow accounts that you know will affect you, you could start feeling bad about yourself, but if you choose to follow accounts that makes you happy, for example pet accounts, it could make you happer. But not only does social media affects an individual, it could affect your society. The way you choose how to display and talk about your country for example would have an affect on the people of your country as well. Not only does your country have access to the internet, but almost the entire world. Although social media could have a bad affect on society sometimes, it actually could be very helpful sometimes. People often raise awarenesses,  post useful things that could help you with your life and your studies; Choose your words and what you decide to post wisely.
Social media plays a big part in this generations lives. it is the main platform where people share their activities,  maybe some   personal lives, and also in business. But how do we know when it affects us or each person indiviually. Everything in life has its bad and sides and good ones, so it is logical for these online platform to own the same concept. If a person knows how to use Social media in a good way, then there will not be any harm on the society. People tend to share positive messages, enjoyable trips and also some tips on how to survive life! but as i said before, everything in life has their own downfalls. A lot of people that live in this world at the time mostly share some bad intentions or behaviors. They tend to send out harmful messages or bad examples  on youth, which can lead  damaging a person's life. For example, bullying plays one of the huge factors in this generations hardships and negative emotions life depression or low self-steams. It does not really matter weather it is one person behind a screen or multiple ones, it would surely scar them in their life. That is why we should always keep in eye on how the children of this century use technology or any use of social platforms. Because either they affect others or others affect them. In the very last, no one can stay away from social media. It is a very affective and addicting use of technology. We just need to know how to use it so we can send out positive outcomes for the people out there, and also we benift from it ourselves.
Social media is an unstable ride as an individual, its really that easy for social media to get you depressed or extreemly happy or simply just confused. The way you brows social media is really important it will allow you to have a great time or the total apposite. As an indivisual i see  Twitter and facebook are the most two social media sites that  affects others so easally  wather posiativelly or negativelly, its easy to let other get affected by your opinion or  you  getting affected by their opinion. Another thing we shoudl all keep in mind,  now adays most of the comunication are done thrugh online sites which sometimes leads into chaos out of  missunderstood text or even doing anything wrong without knowing that its actully wrong. The social media leaves an unlimited acces to you to throw in your thoughts and you might get judged and you might not. Its really important as a user to know the safest way to be around social media without is affecting you baddly  nor you getting addicted  or simply change you as a person to the version you never thought you would be one day. Be wise and brows safely.
Have you ever heard about social media and how does it effect individuals and society? most of the people around the world uses social media they use it in their daily life routine.  alot of people are addicted to social media and its really scary. its so addictive that people cant live without it and the use it everyday  and spend hours on their phones. social media is really effective for adults and children and their  is alot of negtive things that happens in social media. their are  alot of negtive ways people use their social media like cyberbullying and  alot of negtive things. people use it to communicat with other people around the world and to know more about cultures and the way of people thinking. they can also have their own bussiness in social media . most of them use social media to entertain them and to weist their time so the time would go faster.  alot of them use it in a wrong way they bully others they sometimes share others privecy so they can get a revenge by hurting and sharing others privecy. theirs  alot of effective things people do by social media. people should start thinking wisely and knowing how to use social media in a good way. they also should talk about it with their children and tell them how to use it in a good way. most of the parents dont think about it and the ignore the fact that social media might effect their childern and they way they're thinking.
Social media has become the most thing that has been taking up all of our times, it has a few disadvantages and a few advantages. A few disavantages are that it could be taking up our times and it could be distracting us from the impotant things like education or spending time with your family, it could also be bad because of spending too much time caring about your likes on instagram or the amount of followers you have, you'd be forgetting to live your life the way you want to. Although there are also a few advantages to social media, like sharing pictures with your family/friends who are abroad and you can also be checking the news on whats going on in our world  the good news or the bad news. In conclusion, i believe social media could affect  alot of people but it just depends on the way they like to use it or the way they view things in their perspectives  wether good or bad it all depends on the person doing it. Some people may be doing  because of what other people like to see and as i mentioned above, they would be forgetting to enjoy their lives because they focus too much on what others want to see.
Social media affects individuals and the society in so many different ways, in general spending too much time on your daily basis on social networking could adversely affect your mood and health. Social media could cause anxiety and depression if it was  more than the average consume, however by using social media in a good way it would affect you dirasticely and will be helpful towards the person and the society. People use social media for many things such as socializing and finding information which tend to be the most popular of  all, sometimes its good and sometimes its bad. Social media can improve your knowledge and makes studying easier, back in the days people used books to find they information they need but now they have google which does most of the work this is one of  many positives of social media. The negatives that the social media offers are cyber hacking and cyber bullying which is a major crime, cyber bullying could cause some mental issues such as destroyed self-confidence and the feeling of harrasement from others. In my opinion i think that social media is such a good thing which is so helfull however, everything has the good and the bad so we dont relay on just social media we also need to socilize in real life.
Most of the people nowadays use social media, but not all of them use it i a proper way. It has advantages like, communicating with people, using your free time, improve your reading skills and many other. In the other hand, it also have disadvantages like, it may cause weakness in the eyes and some physical problems, it weakens family relationship. Families send there children outside of the country to study, they communicate with each other to ask about there child and how he is doing through social media, and friends also communicate with each  from other countries and far distances. using  free time in social media is a good way to know what is happening around you and in the world. you can get news and information easily while sitting in your place without waiting for someone to tell you or even waiting for the programs to start. sometimes you dont find books in the library so the only way to get them is  reading them online, in this way you can improve your reading skills. One of the big advantages is health problems, becuase most of them have no cure. like the hunchback people and also the eye which is the most important thing in humans. families want to sit together to share there moments and emotions, but when childrens connect to wifi they forget everything around them and dont care about anyone. in this way every family membre sit alone without the other. In conclusion, you may use it in the right way to improve many thing and communicate with people from far away. and you can also use it in a wrong way and cause problems for yourself.

Social media is a sight were everyone around the world can accsess it, where they can talk to each other through a screen, it notifies you about everything that happens around the world  if there is a fight happening, an event and everything you can imagine. But the question is how does it affect us? Social media affect us in both ways  either in a positive or in a negative way.

To conclude, it depends on the person how social media affectes them eitheir in a negative way or in a positive way or maybe even in both.
In today's world, social media is the most populer thing that everyone are using it to communicate with  eachother around the world, and in this essay i will explain how it affect us in a good and a bad way as a society. Firstly through the social media apps we can see  alot of different kinds of social media users  (fashion,blogers,vlogers,elc..)   that provid us  different ideas but at the same time some accounts might includes some bad subjects which is not polite for others.For  example a few people     creat a huge accounet will  alot of views to bully the populer people which we call it a """cyber-bully""" and this effect those who are getting bullied in a negitive  way.Secondly the social media got another disadvantage which is common between the teenagers or generally the students and using social media is distracting them during the classes also at the home they might forget to finish their work and that will lead them to miss the deadlines so their grades will discrease and it will prevent them to achieve their goals and to sucsses. In the otherwise  social media got  alot of advantages such as helping us to get to know  alot of people and to make a friendships in onther countries which benefit us to know more about different culturs.In  addition, we can spend our free time scrolling through the social media and that  a fun thing to do to get out  the stress after a long tiring day so you can play games, chat with your friend and to know the recent news about what is happining in the world. In my opinion, even though i used to think that social media is  wasting of time but i realized that no one can stop using it since it have been a very important part in our daily life.

 United Arab Emirates is one of the countries that has changed derastically in around 50 years only. Because of Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan's clear vision,  with the help of his brothers,  the presidents of the other Emirates, all together they have taken the country to another level of development among all aspects. One of the most important aspects of development is education, which is the base of every other type of development that had occured in this country. In the past, Shiekh Zayed Bin Sultan concidered education as the base of what he had in mind and where he would like to see the United Arab Emirates in the coming years. Schools were built all around the country. Boys and girls were recieving education from highly educated teachers coming from the Middle East and few West countries as well. Students to Shiekh Zayed were the real investment. He said once, the real investment isn't in fuel or pearls, but  the youth of this country. He provided education, schools  and universities, highly educated teachers and professors, and belived in his people. All of that in the past took the United Arab Emirates to the point it is in right now. In conclusion, I think development starts from education, and all efforts you put in education is never a waste, but a way of growing into a better individual.
Social media is an essential to human beings as it is a way to communicate with your surroundings, as well as people from different parts of the world. I'm going to demonstrate my thoughts on how it affects invdividuals and our society. To start off, influencers play a huge part in social media because they're considered role models which leads to individuals replicating their personality or lifestyle. Moreover, it can affect the people negatively or positively. Another point to add,   society has shown a variety of personalities, styles and humour which is because of social media. People are finding their interests, friendships and long-term happiness through social media. This  not only bonds differents societies, but also cuts discrimination and racism. People are getting well educated, knowing their limits to what they can say online and how much they can say. They've become more aware of what's happening around the world like global warming, natural hazards and poverty. Human beings have gained skills that will benefit them and their future. To sum up, although it can affect individuals and societies in a negative way. There are a lot of things that positively impact the people which led to many solutions and cooperation.
Social media is important for communicating with others individuals in the modren world, However it have multiple disadvantages on  individuals and the society that we live in. in the other hand their is also multiple advantages, such as communicting with family, making friend over-seaes, learing about many differant cultures in the world and share knowlage with people across the world. Social media can affect people who are not aware and mindful of there habits on social media and what they view in it, and  using it in a negative way such as abusing or cyberbulling and stealing personal information, many individuals nowaday they are addicted to there phones specifically  social media, and on a bigger scale how  it affects society, in some culture such as our culture with a lot  concentration on others culters it affects it sometime in a negative way specially when you dont know  alot about your own culture you tend more towards other cultures
Social media became vital in every individual's life, it is a weapon with two sides, and it can be used in different ways.Most  of them use it for entertainment and enjoyment, some use it for beneficial reasons such as marketing for products, and others for socializing with people around the world.Social  media can affect the society in a positive or negative way based on the way it is used among the community.In  my opinion using those social media applicattions can harm the society, and especially the young generation.Since  it is known that teenagers are addicted to social media, it is the parents role to limit the time they spend on those websites. Social media play an important role in one's mental and physical health.It  may limit the growth of the mind and body, since people get engaged to their devices and never know when they should stop.The  dangerous side of this weapon, is that it could lead to many problems such as bullying that may lower the self-esteem of an individual.In  addition, social media can stop creative people from thinking and developing their skills, which may lead to low financial growth in the country.In  conclusion, it is the individual's choice if he/she would spend hours on useless devices, or help in the devlopment of his/her country.
Social media have a lot of impact over each person and over that society , in this essay I will discuss the main effects of them . Firstly , the social media have effected a lot of people were some of them had a positive effect over themselfs and the other with a negative effect , and we can esstemait this trough the years . the positive effect that the person have beenn effected  from the social media is that he/she can promote to themselfs if they have a business or something they do and they want other poeple to see it and appreciated so they feel happy , confident and try to improve themselfs .The positive effect over the society is beeing more socialized with people , promote to other people businesses and that lead to a strong and good relationships beatween each other. Secondly , as will as the social media have a positive effect it also have a negative effects wich is not spicifying the people ranges such as child , youth , teenagers and adult who have to sign up for these applications beacuse if all of the poeple have sign up so there will not be a limit of applouding thing maybe  child could not see accourding to his/her old rang. In conclude , social media have a positive and a negative effects that effects the each person and effects that sociey in general .
It really affect us !! Do you love setting on your phone2 how often do you use it2 did you ever try to count the hours that you set on it every week2 I think that it will be unbelievable for you if you saw the results. In fact, most people spend so much time on it while their thoughts are telling them that it is still too short and it is still too early to leave it now. Accually, that might be a bigger problem, because some people say that they are using it individually, so they are not responsible of other ones. However, the truth saya that they can be not just responsible of them, but aslo the main reason for this to be common in the society day by day. At the end of this, we should all be aware and think again carefully when we start using social media. And you must know that the way you are using it either good or bad will affect you and all people. My mom used to tell me this all the time, but the more I grow up, the more I understand what she was trying to make me understand.
Social media is the most popular thing that is happening around the world these days, it made people's lives more easier through communication, shopping  online,education or even knowing the news that are happening in other countries.Social  media helped individuals and society in several different ways, but not everything is positive in the social media world,  ofcourse there would be some negative  affects.Sometimes social media can ruin face to face communications,for  example people would be lazy to meet up or even visit their loved ones, because they would relly on social media and text each other, which is sad, another negative affect that might happen on any person is bullying through social media which it has  name for it (cyber bullying). Spreading rommers on social media is also a big negative affect on the society.Its  important that people should balance their time on how much time do they spend with their families and social media. ,social media has both pros and cons  affect on either individuals and society. As i said social media is the most popular thing that is happening nowadays. but people should try and avoid anything negative  would happen. and everything would be great.
Social media is one of the most important things in our life and it is essential to our living. like any other thing social media has its advantages and disadvantages and it affects everyone around us  adults, elders and even kids. We use social media to entertaine our self's and forget about the people around us,  our friends,  family we stopped communicating and doing activites together, our biggest concern now is what people are posting or where the celebrties are. Some of the advantages of social media are  it makes you connect with other people around the world and it improves your knowledge about things  you'reintrested in and its also helpful for educational purposes. Sometimes and it helps you know what's going on around the world. Some of the disadvantages are  lack of communications within yourself, you forget about people and focus on things that are not important in your life and it could also affect your studying, you would be too distracted and forget to study or do your aassignments. Some people even get addicted to social media which could cause eye sight problems, back problems and many other things. Everyone should use social media in a way that it wouldn't affect their personal or social life and we should learn not to abuse it especially with children parents have to monitor and see what their kids are doing because they would be  mostlyaffected at a very young age they wouldn't know what's right and wrong which could result  bad habits. Thank you.
Some people say that social media is a bad thing for our society,  some agree some don't but is it really bad or is it good?.  Am going to write about how social media effect us as a society and and individulas. social media can be very helpful and also can be so dangoures, it can help you connect with people who live miles away and it helps people to make new friends from other countries also some people start  business in social media wihch is so hlepful, also it helps people to know what is going on in other countries and what is happning in the world . however social media is not all so happy and positive. In the other side there is a very negtive side of social media which can destroy other people lives. For example some people post inpropreat post in social media which can get in the hands of kids and destroy there inccont mind, also your privet life can get leaked easliy which can mess up your mental health just like cyber bullying which is so commen in social media and nobody is trying to stop it even when there  is alot of people who took there own life beacuse of it and i think we should all try to think of ways that we can stop it. Personly i think it depends on yourself you could use social media in a healthy  pretty postive way or you can destroy your life and others by getting in the negtive side, which i wish everyone would avoid getting in the negtive side.
How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media can affect positively and negatively sometimes, Social media is a good thing to use but some people use it in a wrong or harmful way. When you bully people or if you keep posting un propper pictures or videos in social media that may cause rumors. Social media can make you interact and communicate with people from all around the world and by that you can know what's new from all the countries and you can also communicate with your ssiblingss if they're far away from you. You can show people your culture and your daily routine and share it with them and they will be more knowldgeable about your country and what's happening with you. Their is a lot of rumors and bullying that is done by people who uses social media in a wrong way. Social media affect the society in a lot of ways, you can put your latest news and spread your word with only one post or tweet in social media. Everyone uses social media nowadays so it will be easy if you wanna annouance something. The society use social media positively most of the time and that's a good thing to do insstead of spreading rumors.
As we know everything has  good and bad  side,People use social media in many ways and for many things such as knowing each  other,sharing information or even search for them , on the other hands social media could be stressful or give negative emotions,social  media has helped and hurt the scoiety, it can improve or destroy the scoiety , another way that it can effect on the scoitey is that it can effect politics  ,bussnies as well some of the negatvie effects comes from cyber bullying , lets take a look on how does it effect the person well it effects on them by many ways people nowdays chat through the phones they don't see each other in real life or even have time for each other it also effect on the person behavior,social  media can also steal our sleep from us it also increase the amount of anixety and stress the risk that many of us need to be aware from is cyberbullying,as  I mentioned before it decreasses face to face communication ,reduce family closeness ,cause distraction and lacks emotional connection , people who are addicted to social media may experince negative side effect such as eye strain,stress   so it has a negative impact on your health,we  should use social media less and work on socializing more , we can all change that bad habit to something new and good, we should care more about our time and learn new things,do   new things rather than stalk people or just sit for hours on social media , we have to make a change!.

Social Media And It's Affect Social media has been the main thing in our lives nowadays, everyone and in all different ages is using social media in almost everything and it has gotten to a point where our days can't function properly without social media. We use it to communicate, to calculate, to navigate, and to help us in many other things whether it was necessary or not. And without further a do, let's get to how it affects us, as individuals and as a whole community. First I'll start by saying  social media is addictive, people get addicted to using social media whether they were young or old. Moreover, that leads us to the first affect on individuals, social media might get us addicted to the point where we get distracted, frustrated and worried without it, the intensity of this might change from a person to another but it still is affecting to most people. On the other hand it can have a positive affect too, like functionuning during the day more efficiently and quickly, we calculate faster, we don't get lost and we contact our loved ones more easily. Being an individual is also being a part of a community, there are small communities or big communities,  small like a group of friend or family,  big like a whole country or reigon. Therefor whatever an individual goes through or does might also affect the whole community he's in. Now we all are individuals and social media has it's affect on us as individuals already, but how did that affect us as a whole community then? First as families or group of friends we started getting distant and distracted with our phones and social media accounts during gatherings. But if we look at it from a wider perspective,  as a whole community in a country, the positive affect is taking over since we connect to the outer world faster and we share our cultures more openly, that made our civilizations connected and it took a bigger step into creating better generations. In conclusion, having social media in our lives will surely have it's affect on us whether we wanted it or not, I personally think it's not something we control. But we are all in this together so taking in the affect from social media doesnt matter but what actually matters is how we take it in,  do we choose to make is a positive affect? or a negative one? becuase in this, it's all up to us and what we choose.
Effects of Social Media Social media are applications or websites people use to communicate and share intrests, and it is has a lot of effects on individuals and society, these effects can be either negative or positive depending on the way you use social media. Social media can help you save a lot of time and effort, it also can enrich your brain with a numerous amount of information about other cultures. Using social media, you can connect with the other half of the world by a click on a button. Social media can also help in the process of learning, it makes education so much easier, instead of searching in books that will never end, you can type what ever you are looking for and you will find all the information you need in a blink of an eye. On the other hand, there are also a lot of negative effects including health issues, these issues can be either mental or physical. Using social media a lot can cause anxiety and depression, it also affects your physical health by having sight problems. Social media can have a huge negative impact on society if it was not used properly, citizens might lose their natoinal identity and forget their traditions and cultures, which is a big part of the society and what makes it unique and different. As I mentioned before, social media is a strong effective weapon that you can decide whether to use it for your advantage, or it might turn against you, and in my opinion, it has a lot more positive effects than negatives, so be wise and use it correctly.
Title: Affects of social media on individuals and society In the past years, some programs were created and emerged in the world for individuals to use as a tool for communication and they were named as social media programs. These programs are: Snap chat, Instagram, Whatsapp, etc. These programs had a great effect on both individuals and society on both ways negatively and positively. For the positive aspect, social media facilitated the way of communication. It made  easier for individuals in the society to communicate with other individuals through these programs by calls or even texts. People started using these apps beacuse, other than its easy to use, it also offers free phone and video calls so people wont have to pay for the companies that offer payed calls. Moreover, social media programs made it easier for people to spread information or spread aspects of cultures. Social media programs made it easy for people to access information from individuals all over the world and that helped in the increase of globalization. On the other hand, social media also has some negative affects on the individuals and the society. Because of these programs, people started to prefer to communicate with others online only and not face to face becuase they find it easier to express their feelings. This kills their social skills and make them become anti-social. Furthermore, people tend to spend more time with themselves alone using social media rather than spending it with other people and even their family members. This tend to also ruin the relationships between family members. As a conclusion, social media affected individuals and the society a lot and in both ways  negatively and positively. It is true that almost everyone in the world uses social media and it affects everyone, but the individual using it can decide whether to use it in good terms or bad terms and watch whether its affect is positive or negative according to their decision.

Besides all the positive effects social media has on individuals and the society, it also has a negative impact on people. After the growth of social media, people became less in contact with their family and friends in real life, it has taken all of their time and there are no face to face interactions anymore. Another major effect of social media on kids and teenagers is cyber bullying. With the constant use of social media for  majority of their time, teenagers are facing  alot of harmful things over the social media applications without the knowledge of their parents and family members. they are being bullied or can get in touch with some dangerous online predators. social media have become a major part of our life. its a source of entertainment and communication, and has many beneficial uses. it has a big impact on individuals and societies, but if we use it wisely it will not harm us and effect us negatively.

c) How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media is the most common thing these days, every single one of us have a social media app, and of course a social media account, and everyone  of us has his own way of using social media apps, there  is who using social media to publish his own work, such as paintings, photographs, or even writings, and this is why it exists in the first place, it's there for the people to communicate and share whatever they would like to share. There's a special kind of people in the social media which they are popular and having a lot of followers, sometimes it's a good thing and sometimes it's not, it depends about the reason of why is this person is that popular?, because it's not always a good reason, and if it's not that's a thing that we will be scared of, because today it's only a few of them, and tommorow it will be a common thing to see famous people, being popular for the same reason. Social media has made our life easier, we can communicate with each other wherever we are in the world, we can share photos, videos, or whatever we would like to share with our framily, friends, or even followers we don't know, which makes everything easier than what it used to be, but we should maintain our privacy, and we should keep ourselves safe, so we don't share our private photos, and we should keep everything private between us as a family, or friends.
c) Social media has been in our lives for over decades everynow  and then people would argue about its affects upon society itself. First and foremost, research suggust that social media had the quite  impact on technological innovation and the enviromental change that founded our generation to become what it is today.Yet  there are advantages and disadvantages to using social media applications for instance, people would spend most of their valueble time on checking how many followers,likes  and comment did they recieve today?what did  a famous and well known scoial media star posted or said today..etc.  Secondly, people would completely fall for the idea of becoming the center of attention and this could leave a permemanet damage on such individals who idealize other people's opioin over their  own.Since most of the vast majority of people are insecure about their appearence,personailty and with lack of confidence and self-esstem this might become a bigger obstacle to manage in the near future where they have to take responsiblity and be able to decide whether it  in their favor or not and that's how it affects indiviuals and society. In conclusion, I beileve that people should be awre of their actions and manners when it comes to posting anything online.
Important The UAE in the past was like an ancient castle in the UAE today, It has changed a lot in every field and sector, you cannot even relate the UAE in the past and now!. Everyone can tell that amazing insane develompents!, the UAE has not changed in a long period of time, it's just 47 years and everyone know how quick it transforms from an empty desert to a city that no one can forget. In every year the UAE improve a lot of things,  for instance education, health and  medical sector  by proving the latest devices and machines for a better life   better society, but the UAE has a two important develompents at the moment in my prespective. First, In the tourism sector, they built the best luxury places for people who love the fancy lifestyles,  hilarious adventurous places for thrill seekers as the longest zipline in the world, skydiving,  scubadiving and other activities, also for those who love to relax and meditate,  literally for all types of personality they can had the fun,  relaxation, and for a business purpose as well. Also about the second significant develompents is how the UAE relate with other country, the UAE nowadays become the first passport around the world due to the great tolerant relationships between it and other countries, as it confirm the concept of peace, respect and fairness. This develompent made us better than every country as it made other competitive to be the best that would make the world a better place, thats not only change us but others as well. The UAE has made a lot of develompents to reach a high standars no one else has reached, furthermore it is keep in develompent. Tourism and the great relationships are  the main factor ever and its plays a good role as you can see.
There are some people  use social media in a positive and  negative way in the society. Social media, has its way to communicate with people and socalize on the web.  Meeting new people that can help you find jobs and even help you improve and become a better person.There  is a positive effect on using social media such as bussiness, politics or searching for informations. As well as negative effects such as cyberbullying, privacy and fake news.To  start with, some people use social media in a postive way in the society. For example, opening a bussiness to help and support others by having a low and high prices or having an advertsing for the bussiness to surrond it to the world.On  the other hand, some also use socail media in a negative way. For instance, bullying others through social media, or meeting strangers through social media which can increase problems in the society. There are also people that pretend to be other people to get kids , younger people and even teenagers to gain there trust and use them in a negative way. Moreover, there is people asking for personal information to get use of you by having your personal details such as bank accounts or anything related to you and  might be a fake website. Social media effects people in a positive and negative way in the society. However, it depends on how people use it either in  pos 
Social media has its benefits, but it also can have a negative impact on society and individulas, both of which can affect your business. Social media can be used in ways that promote positive and productive ideas in society. These positive behaviors make social media an invaluable tool to young people if uesd correctly. Social media can be used to educate young people, it also can be used as a voice of reason in society, and it also gives teens skills to become more confident and independent. On the other hand, people who are addicted to social media may experience negative side effects such as, eye strain, lack of sleep and stress. As more people start to use social media platforms there has been an increase in the amount of communication used through these platforms. Although there has been an increase in communication, it is not necessarily the healthiest way. Many users have become addicted to socail media, resulting in more people of isolating themselves from society. With social media playing a huge role in today's society, we have lost our abitlity to understand emotions. If socail media has been used in the right way, it will have the ability to make our lives easier and convenient. One thing which cannot be denied is that it is too difficult to abstain from social media.
Tolerance Tolerance is  very humanitive and importante thing to have in a person. If everybody have this fabulous skill we will be living in an incredible harmony and peace. Tolerance can be adabted by living end being ingaged in a society that have that skill. And I think  the UAE society in general is a tolerant comunity. You can see the how the UAE welcome all type of people and make them live together in peace. People can live together in peace if they where tolerant and understanding. The UAE promote the culture of tolerance by having a Tolerance Day that present how importante it's  to be tolerant in almost every where. one of the companies arranged a wonderfull mini global village. And every contry made a show that present a thing about there culture. This activity increaseed the rate of people that will conseider the tolerance as an important thing to have in a society. Which is a woderful way to represnt this amazing facelity. I think people can be tolerant easly if they were guided in to the right direction. Because the human learn  and adabte from it's envirinment and surrounding. And I belive that the Uae will be one of the best society in the world.
development in the UAE there is a lot of developments that  is happening in the uae since the past century and its been happening quickly and effectivley until now to build a developed and forward thinking society and open minded mindset, whether its exterior wise, economically,  politicaly, development in general would help the UAE to be modern in some ways but keeping it culturaly and traditionaly alive and colourful. The most important developments that are happening in the UAE in my opinion is education, looking back at where we used to be and where we are now is overwhelming when you think of it, education has been developing since the day it was brought to the uae even before the union of the seven emirates, the UAE has always been setting a goal for better education to its citisens, with that other developments has happend, even now the education sector is being developed to produce a well thinking socieity and forward thinking, also with education comes a developed nation with a developed nation comes more working oppertunity and with that comes better living for the person and the whole country too. education is the important thing for everyone and thats why i think its the most important development that is happening in the uae and its still developing to give out the best education for the citisens because without education there wont be a country that is affective and effective at the same time. And finally with that i'd like to end it with saying that education is so important to me and im happy that its developing in the uae and its been developed because it important  with a developed education comes a developed country
Social media is something people has addictted on in a short limit of time. The social media has taken over all the society either young or old people. Moreover, everything has it own positive and negative side. In fact, social meda is a good way to communicate with all people around the world such as family and friends.  Social network also helps you to know what is happening around the world in an easy way, its just one click and all the informations will pop out. However, the social network can also affect  on  bad way on people specially young people in this generation. As well as that, using technology can affect on your health too, It can hurt the childerns eyes or back while sitting  a long time using the mobile phone, ipad,  laptop. Also lets not forget that young people minds and thought are easy to change and totally different than how old people think, so its easy for them to go through underage websites that may cause a harm on them. In my point of view, everything is fine unless people use it in the wrong way, parent should be aware of what their childrens are watching.
Social media has  huge impact in our sociaty nowadayes in both ways postive and negtive. Social media has changed the world in many ways for example, in education, and communicating with  others.However, few people do not like how social media changed on how they communicate because they find  comunication through social media is growing their relationships with family, friends, and others apart moreover, some people  gainst because online communicate can affect   teenagers and some adults on the way they speak they are not confedint enough to be outgoing and talking in person because, they are used to chat online more than talking face to face.On  the other hand, it is most commenly used by teenagers they think communicating online made life much easier,    faster to talk. Communicating online is faster than being able to meet and easier to be friends with other nationality and getting to know other through social media.
Social media has a huge impact on people as it has taken over most of their lives. This of course has it's effects          on both the society as a whole and the individuals residing in it, whether they may be positive or negative. There are various ways that social media can be used for the better. It could help people raise their voices, spread awareness worldwide, reach a bigger audience, and possibly change lives. There have been many cases where social media platforms were used to aid people who were unfortunate and in desperate nedd of help. For example someone could be severly injured and on the verge of death and is not financially capable of paying their medical bills,  social media can gather donations and save the person's life. Some other ways of change can even be political and different ways of participating can be as simple as signing a petiiton. However there are also the horrbile aspects of social media: the dark side. This includes cyber bullying. Cyber bullying doesn't necessarily just mean calling people names, it can also mean spreading rumors, posting unconsented images, leaking numbers, etc.. People don't realize how much of an impact they can have on someones life. They should always be kind to one another because they can never know what someone might be going through. Bullying can cause depression or even death if not handled well.
As social media spreads around the world, positive and negitvie actions affects diffrent societies. Social media has become important because it made life much easier. Communication , looking fo information and finding a location is easy because of social meadia. It has an effect on mostly childrens and immiture teenagers but adults are safe because of the knowlage of haw to use it in a safe way. Social media's saftey deppends on the society people lives in for example, dubai has a station locatied in the police station specifacly for social media the make sure that people are safe from any wrong information or kids   being lied to from unknown people, they make sure that everyone is using social media the right way and they watch messages that comes from outside of the country like terrorists plays with teenagers minds, they will get in touch with people to arrest the bad guys. In some other countries people might not care about the use of social media they say that it is useless and a waste of time. in my opinion, social meadia is very helpful and its the fastest way of commuincating with people around the world and its very easy for the goverment to locate and emergency that could happen anytime around the world and its easy for people who has hurricanes, torrnado and volcanos  gets an alert and have time to evacuate their houses and get to a shelter to be safe, thats why social media has a huge part of our life.
Social media has a huge influence on our society specially  this generation. We learn everything through social media, new ideas, new lifestyles........  Old generation did not have social media to be influenced by it. There are postive and negative things about social media. The postive things is that you can communicate with your friends and family and see their experience and  events they went.  Also we can see our idols,  people who infleunce us  daily. We can be influenced by good things like healthy lifestyle. Social media also encourages and support many people, like  good comments we get from others, and the ability to share our experiences. Also by having social media you can know everyday's  news and what is trendy. Social media can also be negative in many ways. People can know your personal information like where you live or can hack your account. Also there are many negative people on social,  who will give you  bad feedbacks and discourage and make you feel insecure. Social media can be a very infleunce that leeds to suicide, bad decision, jeolusy..... In conclusion, I think everyone should have social media  but not at a young age and we should all be careful how we use it and how we infleunce others.
Now a days, social media is everywhere. If you want to know about anything such as news, what will happen in future or anything else you can see  in social media and everywhere just use the Internet. Social media just keep us away from our family, we spend most of the time using social media but its a very good way to communicate with it, like  some of the families are outside the country so you can communicate with them by using it also with your friends or anything you want to do you can reach it. Now, its easy to get what ever you want by using the social media,  example: If you wanted to buy some clothes, food and etc. you just contact who ever does these business and it reaches your home. Yes, social media it does affect individuals and society by people who just waste their time not doing anything but sometimes it doesn't affect the society because by using it in a good way and doesn't waste their time. People get addicted to social media and sometimes it leads to suicide, we heard a lot of suicide that happens these days, that's why they should try their best to get closer to their family
Social media is  huge part of our daily life some of us cant live a day without checking there instgram or Snapchact acounts but how does it effect us and our society?. if we looked back and start the difrance between our small socity that consist  our familes , naighboors and freinds in what aspects is this smal world is difrint than our new urban socity . The socity back there is really deffrint it feels and looks very true if i could say people didnt only recgonize each other behind there phone screen , they didn't show there feeling by likeing or leaving a comment in someone personla account theye where very connacted to each other i can say that theye where  family efore being a scoity . There are many more diffrent efects as well that we can see  throug genration such as the lack of confedince kids now days can't possible comnicate whith other kids because of there lack of colnfidance and i toatlly blame social media ,this will totally effect the socity in a very nigtive way , imagine having an employee that can send perferct emails and post marvlouse shots for instgram but can't commnicate with other emplyee's woudn't that be a tragic to the socity . In the other hand social media has many postive factors on the individuls and society. You can easily expand your knowldge by following some blogs all around the intrint , moreover the UAE followes the smart govrment policy so you can easily pay your bills or ask a quastion just by a click of your mouse.
On the age of developments we have many new technology. Social media is one from the fastest and the newest tecnhology that  used to share the information and to learn about other cultures, social media  used to contact friends and get new relations withe new people that you haven't met before. Anything in our life has  positive and negative impact on us, for example social media like; twitter, snapchat and youtube. they all have affect our life  in  personal way  and on the society. Starting with  positive way, social media teach us to learn new things such as, leanring about other cultures,  knowing about other countries. Also social media change our personalties in a way that let us to do like others or to take the good things from them. But it also can be effective in  negative way so we might get addicteded by bad habbits or by something againts our religon. On the other hand, social media has  big impact on the society, while something new get's on, everybody talks about  and they might buy  if it was a product. In our decade, social media makes life easier, it connect different people of all countries in a simple applications. We exchange habbits, news, knowlegment and experts. social media changes our life, changes our society and changes our personalties. Finally, I think that social media is one from the best new technology that had made life easier and it spread educations. Also, it's one from the most effective media that made our life better.
Social media have  evaluated throughout the past few years. people are addicted to social media apps which have affected them and the society in a positive way and a negative way. First of all, since social media provide people  the help to reach out to the whole globe it actually gave us  alot of benefits such as being able to commmuictae with your long distanced relatives and friends, o finding resources for your projects, learning new skills online and becoming more knowldgeable about the other cultures that are surrounding you. However, since people are using the social media apps for a long period of time, it made them addicted to it. There are some people  doesn't know how to start a conversation with others face-to-face,   some forget how much they spend using their phones which leads to losing their eye sight. Secondly, the fact that people are more open to the world made a differance to our society, It influenced our behaviours and beliefs such as the concept of recycling plastic and having a healthy life style. This helped us improve and evaluate our enviroment which helps our country to get better. The other good point of social media is  it helped our society and the people in it, people can find others who have the same interests as them and it leads to developing confidence that leaves a positive effect and impacts to others. Yet, the bad things about social media is  it could effect our society in terms of tradition, culture, beliefs , our attitude and action. To sum up , social media affect us and our society by the way we use it either positively or negatively.
Social Media Social media is like a plant, you either water it in specific amounts, and after a while it will grow into a beatiful flower, or you water it in big amounts, which will lead to the death of the plant. Social media affect the individual and the society in a way, we decide if it is in a good way or not. Every person is responsible on the way he or she uses the social media. They can educate themselfs by reading news, new information, story, or anything, which will have a good impact on them. On the other side, using the social media in the wrong way could lead to wasting time, or bully others, which in this case will start affecting the society in a bad way. Social media affect the society in a good and a bad way. In the good side, it can spread love and friendship between the people, or in the bad side, it can cause people to bully others, which will create a society that suffer from physicological problems. All of the individuals represent the society, and the society represent all the indiviuals. If the individuals used the social media for a good cause, it will build an educated generation with good manners. In the other hand, using the social media for the wrong reasons will create a generation that suffer a lack of good education and manners. It is your choice and your plant, you can turn it into  beatiful flower, or let it die and be wasted
In my opinion I see  social media have many postive aspects. Social media affect indiviuals and society in many ways , It has a postive aspects and negative  too , some people agree with social media and some of them not , people that doesn't agree with social media can see  it without  benefit and usless but some people use social media as it's a part of their life,some  people uses social  as their work. Now a days everything is in social media, you can watch  news in social media in stead of  television , you can buy online , you can finish your work even , as i said there is good aspects and bad  in social media , it depend on how the person use it , In my opinion , we need social media. It has many benefits , for example , we can buy online instead of going out and be stuck in a traffic , but it's also have negative things, such as watching bad videos , watching bad movie , learning bad words. Finally it depends  how the person use it and what he watches and learn.
Social media nowadays took a huge place in our life. It affect us in both  good and  bad way, however it depends on how the individual use it. Social media is a good way to know about the worldwide news and to contact with people all over the world and thats one of the benefits we can get it from social media. In my point of view, I think that social media is an interesting thing which i made some online friends and they took an important place in my life and I have to talk to them everyday.  On the other hand, some uses social media in a bad way. Such as, sharing some videos and pictures which can harm people and themselves, and that will affect in a bad way for sure. Although every problem should have a solution, and some solutions could be that to manage time for these applications and monitor people who once used it in a bad way. To conclude, everyone should agree that many people in society at least know about social media if they don't use it. It benefits more than it harms. School and Universties use some applications for their students to help them study and contact them whenever they have some difficulties.
Social media became a trend in our modern society, it became an essential part of our lives. Individuals use social media to communicate with others, play games and much more. Social media can affect the society in a positive and negative way. It affects the society positively by transferring information online where individuals can be informed such as news articals. Social media also helps students in school and teachers to communicate during school hours or after school hours. People use an application called """Skype""" to communicate with their family and friends who are out of the country. Social media also affects the society negatively by ciber bullying and games which can lead to death. In conclusion individuals should not use social media a lot since it can harm their eye site and harms much more things mentally and physically.
The UAE Devlopment If people are wondering about the devlopment that the uae is having, then it's so huge. The UAE have seen many devlopment espically in the last four years. Many thing have changed in a better way. And it brings binift to the country. The UAE worked hard the past few years to get better and better and to move forward in the world of devlopment. Many things have been acheived in a short time of period. All of this is hapinning because of the hard work that people do  weither the old or the young people. Of course the reason of this firstly is the helps and the support that  UAE's government are giving to the people. They offers a lot of thing to let people discover thier selves and to achieve things that will help in  devlopment  the UAE. As an example of the important devlopment is the Burj Khalia in Dubai which is the tallest tower in the world. The Burj Khalifa brough many toursem to the country just to see it. Another example is Masdar city, the city of suistanability. It brings also people to see it which is very helpful to the country. At the end, the UAE will keep devloping tell it achieve what it want to acheive and more, because the UAE's people have the ability to do this. May Shaihk Zayed Bin Sultan rest in peace, the leader of the counrty who changed it to a better place.   
Nowadays, most people depend on their phones for day-to-day chores or activites. So with that being said, social media platforms are widely known and used everyday  by most phone holders. It can have various impacts on our society and on us, as individuals. Plenty of people use social media platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. Sadly, they don't realize the damage it can cause when it is used accessively. Imagine yourself spending most of your day scrolling through your feed, looking at others live in an imaginary and unrealistic world. That can actually cause way more harm than you would think,   constantly having to compare yourself to everyone around you even though, they only share the """good""" parts of their life. Other than that, people who use social media for long hours tend to neglect most of their tasks so that can lead to them being unsuccessful in life, because they never tried attaining their goals. Our society has gotten use to the idea of living life through a screen, so most of them don't really mind it and have accepted the fact that it may never change. As a society, we need to make a change and it needs to happen fast. Making people around us aware about the impact social media has on us is one thing we all need to do. I think that sooner or later, people are going to start realizing the things that are happening around them and will thrive to make a difference.
Social media is  way for people to connect to the world. They could know the news of what is happening on this world in a much quicker way. As they could also get closer to people from across the world. There are many ways social media can help people change their life styles to be better than their past life styles. Social media can also motivate people into following their dreams. For example a person that can cook and has many recipies might upload some of their recipies so it might be helpful to other people esspecially if they have and allergies or if they are following a diet. People can easily learn about other cultures and traditions and might connect easily to other societies. Social media also proves how individuals from all around the world could be struggling with the same issues which could help them overcome their issues. Even though social media can benefit people there is also a downside to it. One of the downsides is that there is an easy access to cyber-bullying. As well as people might miss use their social media accounts to spread hatred between the people and cause chaos in societies. For example people might spread rumers about a society and not portray it as it acually is and it be cause people to start hating each other. How a person chooses to spend their time on their social media account determines how individuals feel and how they act in societies within the country they live in and all over the world.
Social media plays a big role on us nowadays, it is one of the biggest influence that no human beings are not affected by it whether it is a good influence or a bad one but social media has offered us a lot of useful things to do.  Good things that many users use it for is that instead of wasting money on a ticket they would just explore social media, search for the place or the country you want to know about and you will see an enormous amount of  images,informations, news and many other  things.Communication is one of the best source of social media because you get to communicate with your friends, family and even maybe your long lost cousins that lives overseas in addition you get to meet people arount the world online. On the other hand, there are some cons to the social media community, it can be unhealthy to use it more excessivly because being addicted to anything way to much is extremily bad for your eyes, body and your mental health. Being isolated is a big problem as well and the reason why it is not a good thing is because you spend less or no time with your family and friends in the real world. In conclusion, anything that has  good use can turn into a bad use if it is developing addiction to you. managing your time and using social media the good way is a positive thing.
Social media is really important in this century because it is one of the best and easiest ways to keep up with our society and the whole word. But just like every other innovation social media have their negatives and positives and that can effect our society and us either in a bad way or in a good way. First I will be talking about the positives, one of the positives that I think is important is  social media help us connect with the world and know what is going on in other countries, and another positivity is that it is a really easy way to catch up with family members who live away from us or in another country, these positives effect the individuals mental state, because keeping in touch with our families is mostly our source of happiness and serenity, and if the individual is happy, they can work in improving and developing th society. While on the other side there are the negatives, some of the negatives are that social media is time consuming and a lot of people tend to waste hours and hours of their time browsing random things instead of being productive, if the many members of the society are not productive they could stop the developing of a society and an entire country and other than that if they didn't do anything productive that could lead to feeling useless which will eventually lead to depression. I honestly think that social media is a good thing in our lives but just like everything else, it depends on the user of it and how they use it, if you're using it in a good way then it'll be good and if not then social media would be the worst thing that ever happened to you.
Social media has a great impact on the individual and society. It helped nations to communicate with others. Although social media has benefited the world, it still has its negatives and bad effects on others. So many societies benefited from social media because it helped the schools and  students on their studies, it helped researchers on their experiments, and mostly it helped in communicating and socializing and making new friends. Despite the positives, it also has a bad side that sometimes could put the user in danger. Nowdays the technology became more powerful than before and many people are taking advantage from those developments and using them in the wrong way. There are many examples of those people like the hackers, they could hack into your devices and your social media accounts and steal your personal information and starts to threaten you. Those hackers could also pretend to be someone they aren't and mess around with kids for example. Kids are a really easy target, so those hackers use them and take advantage of them. Now regarding those hackers and technology thiefs, they made the police departments all around the world to have cyber security and make awareness campaigns and take those hackers down using the hackers methods and techniques, and makes the hacker feel like a victim.
c) Especially in the last decade, social media has started to have a huge impact on society in the daily lives of people. These impacts can be both positive and negative. An example of a positive impact is the improvement in communication. Communication as a whole became much more easier and with the help of social media people can now talk to each other even if they are in different countries as if they were actually face to face . Social media has also helped with raising awairness in certain subjects around the world. For example, with the help of social media more people are aware of issues like animal cruelty and social media helps with giving people solutions to help aid the problem, like boycotting brands that are not cruelty-free. However, social media also has some negative impacts on individuals and society. For example, social media provided people with another platform for bullying which thankfully a lot of companies are now trying to take proper measures  in order for online bullying to stop. Instagram, for example, is starting to enforce a system where comments can be censored and certain words and phrases cannot be used. This is useful as it would prevent bad comments from reaching certain individuals and therefore prevents people from suffering from certain mental illnesses like depression, which have increasingly surfaced as a result of online bullying. Therefore, the use of social media has affected society at a large scale, where a lot of their decisions are impacted by their use of these platforms, both in a positive and  negative way.
All of the people now have a smart phone that is full of apps that connects us to the social media, it is a big world that has  positive and a negative affect beacause it is so huge and full of things that you can't belive that it exist. peolple will not belive that there is a bad side of social media so in the next pharagraphs we will talk about the advantages and disadvantages of social media. Social media helped us to connect to the outside world in a different way so we can watch and listen to a differnet languages from another counrty we also can talk to them by translating the words to their language and this is a very easy way to comunicate with far people from the world, we can also discover other countries cultures so this will help us to be open minded and think in another way. As there are many advantages also there are an infinity  disadvantages like you can connect to the world with social media it also makes you an isolated person who loves to set with himself always so the communication with people around him will be less, also he may be watching things that are above his age or things that even older people should not be watching them beacause it will effect them and their mind in a bad way, some peoples use the social media in  way to cheat on people and do things that are bad to take money from those people. So be careful while using social media because even a small thing you see can change a many things in your personalty into a bad or a good way so take care.

Social Media And The Affect It Has On Our Lives Ever since the cyber world has surfuced and the internet has become a household must, social medias have started to appear in many forms. Currently, its one of the most prominent and dominent form of communication as it helps people connect to others from all around the world. It's easy access and simple looks made it into a billion dollar industry and made it's creators into one of the most richest people on earth. The 21st century has been named the technological era, because of how we changed and transformed simple things into mechanical beasts, one of the main things that have been affected heavly is the communications sector as it turned from being a slow moving expensive act into the exact opposite. But as everything that develops, it starts to form some negative affects. Social Media has became such a toxic platform for many people, as lots of negativity has begun to be released from it. The biggest way it has affected our lives is by turning people into loners, teens nowadays are stuffed in their rooms with their eyes glued to screens, and their either scrolling through instagram or watching videos on youtube, it has made lots of teens have social problems, as they start to distance themselves from life outside their four walls. You can witness this affect by watching them present at school, some have lost all their confidence in speaking in front of their peers, as they  gotten used to communicating with them over text. Another way it has affected our lives is by making standerds on many things like weight, looks and even items. This has made users become more self-concious and made them work harder into changing who and what they are just to be able to fit in. But on the other hand, it had many positive affects on us, as it made the road into learning other cultures and meeting new people easier and cheaper, as access to social media has become free and simple, with one click u can make a profile and start chatting with either new people or old friends your dying to connect with. In my opinion, the positive affects of social media outweights the negative affects by a lot, if you surround yourself with the correct people and access benefitial programs you will rarely come across all the negativity.
Social media affects individuals and the society in several ways, both positively and negatively. It all depends on an indivicual's way of using it, some might use it to start a business, just for fun, or even to become an influencer. The way you connect and communicate with others through social media has an affect on you, and the people around you. When one starts a career as an influencer, they choose the path in which they would affect the society and the audience viewing the content. Projecting appropriate content to the audience's age group, with specific interests might positively inspire them to do good, however; creating inappropriate content and views would negatively influence them. For example, young children who follow makeup bloggers would mostly be influenced by them to apply makeup at a young age, in that case, bloggers should be aware of her/his audience's age group. All social media users have different interests, yet most users follow similar accounts for different reasons, some might like the content, or the person behind it, or just because it's trending. Social media apps should have a system for followers, once you start an account you can answer a few questions, which would then make a list with all people who might interest you, and present content appropriate for your age group. To conclude, your intentions and way of using social media reflects on how it's going to affect you and the society.
Social media is where you can chat,  share vidoes or  else by some application, like Instagram, Snapchat, Whatsapp and muhc more. Some people use social media to chat with family, so they do not have to meet each other, this can affect their relationship and they may be not see each other for a long period of time. Today people are sharing them lives on their social media accounts, As well as some of famous people are doing this as a source of getting money, where they have to dowonload a vlog on youtube and sharing all of their events that happens to them. Moreover, these types of vlogs can attract children to do the same thing, and there will be no privacy, everyones life is on social media, specially children  will not be foucs on other staff they will only got busy with social media. On other hand, most of tv  shows are advertising for them social media accounts to get more followers and viewrs, An example, if they have an important news so they will say for people wait  us on instagram at 8:30 AM we will share the news there, so this idea makes everyone to have an instagram account and start to use it wll and have more knowladge about it. To conclude, social media can affect you if you are using it in a bad way, try  to not let it be the most important thing in your life.
Social media is a way that people use to contact with family, friends and others. Social media affect individuals and society by positivity and negativity.

They find it a faster and easier way to talk to them, but have you ever wondered what are the effects  social media?  People like trying new things, and when a new way of communication was discovered and invented, everyone wanted to try it and use it. Accounts from different countrires on different continents were made, and people started making friends they never would have met if it weren't for social media. These friendships help the individuals in learning more about foreign countires and their cultures and traditions. Moreover, making connections with people who have different experiences and oppurtunities broadens their minds and gives these individuals new perspectives on life.

I am gonna talk about how does Social media affect individuals and society.Social  media can effect  UAE is so many diffrent ways. The first thing what probably be social media like snap chat or twitter which is corrupting the UAE in so may diffrent ways they can comunicate with people they aready know and people they dont know anything abot the other person which can sometimes be wrong for the person individualy. The other way social media can affect the society is how people use their phones everywher and for everything that the are doing which makes it even harder to actually comunicate with other people in real life since they are always using their phones to comunicat whith the person that is  infront of them. For example how does socil media affect me individualy is how i am always using my phone even if im sitting with my family which is wrong because i don't always know what is going on with my family and how their day was. How does social media effect the society, for example when im sitting in a waiting area or sitting with friends all the people that are around me are on their phones and when I try to have a convorstion they are not listening because their eyes are connected to their phones and they are not consintrated with anyone around them.What  i'm trying to say by all of this is that people and so do i have to put aour phones or any type of technolagy down for some time which would help us individualy and the society.

Tolerance is an important skill we should know and learn, it helps us to be more careful  and knowledgable with others. However, our community is facing a fact that tolerance can be appllied only for a certain time as we are in the year of tolerance, here in the UAE. Moreover, in the UAE, tolerance is so important for the society, our ruleres decide that this year """2019""" is the year of tolerance. This year in the UAE, we made a lot of talking circles and advicing sessions to let people in the UAE know how much important is it, we started promoting more about this subject in schools, offices and also in the tourist places. H.H.  Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al Nahyan, may he rest in piece, told us that tolerance is not just for us to know what it is, however, it is also for the society and how we deal with others either in our country or with the foriegns. We should show them how respectful we are, we should work on ourselves and be achievers. In conclusion, tolerance is a fact that we should follow in our life always either in our community or with others abroad.
