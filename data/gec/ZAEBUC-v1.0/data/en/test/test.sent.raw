Social media has advantage and dis advantage that can effect in our society.Now a days people read there news frome the social media and they learn also social media has a bid effect on people and childrren .Children learn from celebrityes people learn from each other .
Social media is one of the major things in the world right now, it has helped  alot of people and it has  alot of information about almost everything. For example: most of the news is on social media more than news papers and it shows us things that are not on television and it stays on social media forever. Everything has a positive and a negative, social media's positive affect is that it helps individuals and society, the way that it helps society is that is contains breaking news or election polls or even live events about the election which  ofcourse helps people understand what's going on. The way that it helps individuals is that they can promote themselves with cooking, politics, and just by talking about anything in their opinion. The negative affect of social media on society is that it sometimes cotains rumors or lies that ruin one's mind or changes one's thinking, it can cause a cyber war between countries or even  actual war, while the negative affect of social media on individuals are so bad that some people suicide because of the talks and hate on social media. In my opinion, social media  not  useful more than its useful and it brought  alot of problems to the world.
Social media is the most effective around the world. These days some people can't stay a moment without checking their phones to see what happend around the world by social media. howeve, social media affects on people lives in many sides could be posatively or negatively such as their personality and their jobs. social media can affect on people's personaliteis in  negative way. People can't respect and accept anything around them, they always want more and they don't like small thing.For  instance, people look at thei gifts before the person who brings the gift, they lose the meaning's of the gift.On  the other hand, social media sometimes help people to encourge and push them to complete their education for people who don't complete it yet.For  example, they can see one of the blogers talk about their possion in their jobs after they are done their degree. There are a lot of people  don't accept any kind of jobe because they see  it doesn't propreate with them ,so they stay at home without  job. Social media give them unreal examples about people who have big houses and sport cars ,so they want like them no less. That means people will be unemployee , so the government suffer becouse   no workers  no sources. To sum up, people and society decied how social media affect their lives posatively or negatively. It can affect their jobs and their personality by several ways.
Social media is one of the biggest intersections that we all face on a daily basis. It has its pros and cons in society and individuals. I believe that social media effects people on their way of thinking and how they precieve it, some people know not  believe everything they see online while others tend to believe just about everything they read. Social media and society doesnt mix well all the time and that causes a lot of choas and enourmous destruction to a persons thinking style because society and social media interwine greatly when it comes to huge topics like politics, diversity,  anything that could make a person want to speak up about in this age and time. On the other hand some pros on how social media effects society,   it somehow brings us all together in a way, even if its a small community. Social media benifits our society to do much greater things and we discover a lot by just checking the internet alone. It can provide us  all of the information an individual needs on a daily basis and I believe that helps the society as well as it would help one person alone.
Today, as we all know social media has reached up to that limit where you can find anyone, you can know about everything and can gain knowledge relating to anything. Its good to keep us update with what's going on in the world.but  with all these benefits of social media there are a lot of bad things and criminal activities that might take place. The first disadvantage is that hacking, anyone's personal date can be easily hacked if not properly secured and can be shared all over the internet. the hacker may mis-use their private property. hacking is known as an illegal activities. The other disadvantage is addiction , nowadays teenagers and even kids are getting so much into social media that they can be termed as addicted. Addiction is a bad thing  can easily ruin someone's personal life.
The social media it have many affect for the people it have a good affect and a bad affect , the good affect in the social media it is communicat withe all the pepole in the world and laren a new thing about a life , i see  the social media it is have a big effect in  entarnet it can chang the individuals and society . The social media it have more bad thing  same the some not good news and some pepole usae it in  bad way , to kill pepole and take mony buy  not  good way, also many kids game in this time we need to but account for social media to play in it and in this account  maby  some bad pepole luarne  the kids  bad thing and some kids it kill her family because they told hem that , in my oppinion the social media have  same affect for individuals and society and it keep people make some bad thing
In this days , social media has many advantage and disadvantage and effect us negitevle and positvetly. social media is the apps that  we connect with eache other from different places, such as, Snap Chat , Whatsapp ,Instagram and so on. Social media effect the individuals person in two ways .First, in  positive side , it keep them follow the the famous person.  Also to know a new information, however they can contect with them frenids in the other country. In the other side it can effect them negitevly such as. they can trest who is talking to them also using social media to much will effect them relation ship with them family becose they will use it so much and they will not set with the family . on the other hand .Social media can effect the society in two way. First, it will penifet the community in many side for example , the important news , all the comunity will know what hapend in them country and it can spport them talent by posting in social media your work or what   you done.  but some time it is not a good way to talk or comunicate ,becouse come kind of the comunity are not use it in a good way. For example they will sale a bad products also the relation ship are not reale at all. In the end i wish to try  to less using social media to much  to not effect us negitevetly .
Social media is programs or apps that helps people to communicate with  eachother and find the world news or whats happening. Social media today is so important because people can call their frindes or family if they were far from them. These apps can affect  posivitly or negativley for individuals and socity. For example, people may affect on their health in bad ways like they like to sit alone the whole time and not like to share anything or talk to anyone. That affects  a lot to socity, people won't waste their time in good things like learning new things and having new informations. At the other hand, it can affect posivitly to the person and socity. Social media helps people who read or watch new informations. For example, students can have information for their work and also people can improve their level of education by reading online or watching videos. Social media has two sides but it depends for the person  if he/she used it in the right way. It affects a person and socity a lot in  bad way or in  good way.

The social media have many effect in our life some of them  advantge and some of theme  disadvantgs . I will begin with  disadvantgest . Firstly , some of them ues it in a bad way they do some think bad for the govermment or for the country . Secondly , some of them use it like most of there day and they do not set with there family . Finally , the most of the exedant it is be come from the social media they see the mobaile and dose not care about any one . There are many advantges in our life .

To some up , that will be very important in our life and it is have advanteg and dis advanteg and every think in these life have it . in my opnion it is very important and it is  ezzey way to contact with other .
Naw adays , social media has many affect  individuals and society it has positive and negative thinks.first  of all I will began  abou posetive of social media.The  first psiteve of social media is that exchange of life experiences in the fields of lif.The  socend positive is that acquire important information from its sources.The  next positive is that  give way to creativity.In  addition it help us to comunicat with other peaple in the word. therefore it help us to now the news and what happing in the word.Also  the socai medai had negative tings that affect individuals and society in the word.The  firs negative of social media is that emotional isolation from near by society. The socend negative is that there is a stroing opportunity to spread and promote rumors.In  my oppinions i thnk that evry think in the world has positive and negative think so social media has negative think more than positive think it help us to comunicate withe other people and help us to now  new
social media have a bad effect to our communities. its make people pe alone.Most of people prefer to be at home to watch movies to with their friend in social media, and that makes them only connect to gether in social media, and this makes people only connect to gether by social  media.Because of social media people dont sey   face to face ,and this makes a bad effect to our community.People  should less from using social media  to have a lovely community and  happy community.

Social meadia has two sides . good ,bad ,safe and dangerous . It depends on how we use it and on our intrests too. I believe that latley social media is  affecting invidiuals and society in such a bad way ,not because of social media itself its because of the people using these apps.For  example, lets give a look about people using social media 8 years before , even when they used to use social media , they used to talk and sit with  families and talk more but now all we care about is chatting on our phones. Also , it was all safe and a fun place but now they are all using it as a way to spread hate on a person or spread hate about countries and all  which  not good at all also its not a human being behavior. To be honest I cant deny that social media have a good side too . For example, reaching our families and friends who live in other countries , knowing about important new and much more. I trust that nothing ruined the social media more than the toxic people behind the screen because if they werent there , none of this would happen. thank you
Nowdays, social media is such a popular thing around the world and everyone use it to communicate with their friends and family, there are many negative and positvite uses for the phone, the positvie things for social media is that we had the ability to talk with everyone such  a call or  video call, we can study from the phone and do research to decover new information and have the enough knowlege about something, also there are many apps  help the children to learn and play games. However, there are also negative affect for the one who use the phone for a bad things such as: wasting time on apps that  not important at all. playing and saying bad words for anyone in social media,  post video and picture that  not allowed for childern to watch, in addition, when someone became educted in social media they are not listen and there attention is only in their phone, they dont know what is going on around them and that is not a good behavior at all.
Social media affect These days the social media are taking a huge attention even if thats will affects our life style. Adults and the childrens have a bad using for the soial media and they are sitting on their social media accoutns an hours. Furthermore, there are many affects for usaing social media such as people become more fat and lazy, and they do not playing sports whereas there  some people  are using the soical media  by good a way such as a business way or they share thier healthy life style with us. I prefer to live with  soical media life because I learned  english language and its easy to cotact with my family in KSA.

C) How do social media affect individuals and society ? Social media is a tricky subject. It has a lot of negatives yet a lot of positives. It was created as an easy way for people to communicate and interact with  eachother. Somehow it became a battle of who has more followers or who gets the most likes. An unfollow can be considered rude or it can be taken as an insult. A like means they have  romantic interest, a retweet is like being asked on a date, and so on. It takes up a lot  of teenagers and young adult's lives. Yet, it  also is a way to find news, share your own thoughts and experiences with people, and make new friends. Though I have realized from  personal experience that people who get too invested in social media tend to shut out humans from their surroundings. They focus solely on the social media friends until they realize that they should have been more attentive. Sometimes it's okay to put your phone down and go talk to your mother. It's okay to read a book, go for a walk, draw and unplug. And be careful who you trust on the inetrnet.
One of the most important things now days is social media , it have many positive and negative affect for individuals and society such as decrease the time and make the human counuection less than before , I'll show some deatils down . One of the positive affect is decrease the time to conected with the others in work or with family and the friends , so you  have'nt  planning to have a long ride to get some informaiton from someone for the work , one more thing is you can talk with your friends all the time and where ever and whenever you want to have a call or a chat with them , so that's one of the beniefit of the soical media and a positive affect on individuals and community . On the other hand of the affect of the soical media on individuals and society is make the human coonection less than before , because o the lazy people or most of the people used the soical media to caha with the others even if they are in the same place so hat make the human coonection less than before . Finally , the social media are a good way to connect with the others but we must know that how to use it in the right way to keep it in our side and we get the benieft from it .
The social media he afect individuals and society, however he impact in our health when  use the social medial evry time also he impact the commnicate with other people , in this essay  will talk about how do social media affect individuals and society. First of all , we have some affect , For example when you use social chat after you see the humens in the any place you can commincate  him  same  in the social chat , also he impact the our health when  use the phone too much we should    but some time to use not all  time you use it and we have  big problem for the children who use social media because he can chat with anyone and this think will be a very dengores for the children we should his family see  his children what he do when he play in the phone also how is took with him in the social media and but some time to use for example in the night the phone close autuomaticly this  a good think to save our health for the children . Secondly,  also we have a good think when  use the social media , for example you can chat very fast with any people in  short time also if you have  proplem in your universty you can use the social media using the email to commincate with your teacher and write your proplm and he  give you the solutins  of proplrm in the short time .
In the UAE, they use many kind of social media for  commuity, but most of people are using social media ,exacpt for teenagers or adults lets dicuss about what people are  more using between social mesia and society . people are use  alot of social media . For example , Snap chat, instgaram ......etc. However, some of people are use for society without social mesia. For exmaple, hangout  with friends and talk to your family. In the end, they use  avarage between social media and society. futhermore, they use for their career in the future. In my opinion, it depends  alot for people  can be affect their social media and socicty. Also it can been effect their future.
All people in the whole of the world uses the social media,these  things have many affect to the individuals and society. People these day are always on their smart phone which waste their time on things that are not nesscary,The  social media affect individual in many ways which he doesn't give his family some of his time and to not support his children which will lead him to have a bad grade in his school, this is because his father are always on the social media and doesn't know about  him.The second affect is the relationship in the family , people before the social media there were always together and each one of them where asking about each other,but  in these days because of the social media it affect the society which will lead to  bad result. In my opinion,social  media have some positive affects and negative affects.The  positive affects which  people can learn new thing about life on the social media.the  negative affect  that the social media can damage the people in many ways that they won't have a result to solve these problems.
I think the most important development in  UAE at the moment is the technology . Because now and in the future everything will depend in the technology . Schools, universty , govrenment places , hospitals . All of these places now depend in technology because the technology is the future of the country . The government spend  alot of money for the schools becuase of the laptops , labs , ipads,  computer, and  same is for universty . for hospitals the government buy for each hospital beds, sergey machines,  foods, now for the government places  for example police stations or army bases , the government provide a modren and expensive cars and modren guns , modren tanks , modren planes . Because of that reason I think the technology is the most important development in  UAE.
Social media has shown a big effect on individuals and the society. Starting with individuals not only teenagers and adults that are using social media but also kids. It became so important for people to check their social media every hour and before going to bed and  the first thing to check when waking up. In  old days, people used to visit each other to know what their family or friends are doing but now a days you can check how your family and friends are doing just by  social media either through texting or by watching their stories  "snapshot" "instagram" etc....The  social media effect on the society in my opinion that people starting hanging out less,  families don't meet oftenly but I noticed that it had a positive effect on medical and nutrition awareness people started knowing what is good and bad for their health since it's easier to contact a doctor through social media. To conclude, Social media has a negative and positive affect but its helpful for a lot of things normaly.
Social media The world around us have develop in many diffrent and brilliant ways ,and because of this develpment there's something  live , sleep and eat with , it's something that distroy our real lif communicatin  which called """" social media ' , social media bring  whole the world  from the west side to the north side  in one screen and  one bottom , its such an amazing thing , but do you know how much this app or thing distroy our relationships , health and steal all the moment from us , we havn't live any momentthese  day we just share our food , places , homes and selfies around the world with out taking a breath to just chill and live this preisous moments , and we are suddnly so addicted to this annoying thing with out our consent and in my opinnon i guess it is an illness that kills our brains cells , also in this screen theres   alots of rumors that may ruin our families , community and the whole world , can you just imagine a world that  full of rumors , bad communication and lies , it's such an big disaster that will distracting every thing around us , actually to be more honest and clear there   alots of positive and good  about social media but its depends on how we use it and deal with it , but unfortunstely mostly everyone have certainly used social media in many wrongs ways and that what made me so savagery to this issue , but as i said its depends in how you use and deal with it , In the end i just want you to be more educated and responsible in using social media .
topic (c) Social media is a method used to socialize with people around the world in different ways. Social media has a broad category and is frequently used nowadays. Whatsapp, Snapchat, Instagram, and Facebook are some of the popuplar examples of social media. Moreover, individuals and societies are impacted positively and negatively by social media based on the way they're being used. To begin with, social media has a positive impact on the individual. For instance, it helps people get in touch with each other at  anytime and anywhere at the speed of light. You can do your job and finish your group projects by being in contact with your group members through social media from your own house without gathering to do it together, this helps save time and other resources such as car fuel. Furthermore, social media can entertain you in times when you are bored and you have nothing interesting to do. For instance, you can video call your friend in your free time and enjoy your break without wasting your time doing nothing. In addition, social media can impact you negatively by wasting your valuable time in which you can be productive and achieve something. Social media has a positive impact on the society as well. For example, some company's offer you online shopping through social media such as Instagram, which hepls you save time and shop from your location without wasting your car's fuel and leaving your house while your not in the mood to. Moreover, governments nowadays spread the news via social media which is a place where everyone is active, so the news will be seen by almost everyone. In conclusion, social media became an important thing in our lives nowadays, and people can't live without it. Also, it has both positive and negative influences on the individuals and societies in several ways.
What is social media? Social media is a form of networking that occurs through social applications like instagram, twitter, facebook, and many others. Social media can be used for many different reasons; from advertising to simply keeping in touch with friends. Nowadays, social media has become an essential part of people's lives. Different people use social media for a variety of reasons, it can be used to share parts of an individual's lives with their friends,  getting to know different people from around the world, and some companies are able to market their products to potential customers. Though social media might have many positive attributes, it also has a bad side. Social media makes the spread of information faster and more efficient, but it could be used as a weapon to spread false information, and some people that share their lives or photos on social media may be easy targets to predators and bullies. It could affect an individual in a very negative way if they share too much with strangers on social media, and it could also affect society by the spread of false information. I think that despite its negative aspects, social media can be used to influence society in a positive way by helping people get together,  helping small companies grow, and another amazing thing that I've witnessed on twitter is that many people in desperate need of help are able to reach out to each other during hard times like people in urgent need of medical help, money, or finding a missing child. Social media if used the right way can be used to better society and its individuals.
Social media affects individuals and society in many different ways, as social media has many drawbacks and benefits   which I will be considering some of them in my writing. Social media affects individuals by playing with their emotions as this results in keeping the individual in constant anger , which may also result  the individual in taking unpredictable actions which may be dangerous at times and may lead in harming the society. Social media can even lead to suicide, as it can be because of problems with online friends that may persuade the individual in going through dangerous situations and by persuading them to do it otherwise the online friend may come and attack the individuals parents  that may cause to death of the parents. Whereas the benefits of social media can be for research, as it makes it easier for students to research for any projects and homeworks and it even teaches the students as students can access videos to learn if they have any confusions in some courses which may lead in making it clear for the student faster.To  add on social media can lead to the individual in making new friends and the individual can go on social media when bored.
C) social media is one of the best inventions in our society, because not only did it upgrade our lifestye as individuals  it created an upgrade for all of us human beings. it aleterted the way we view ourselves and other people. take a walk in any place and you'll find that sixty to seventy percent of people  on their phones clutching as if its a newborn child. however before slamming social media and start  hating on it we should outline both advantages and disadvantages of social media. social media has made marketing better with hotels, marketing services. it made stying in touch with family,  friends, easier through the use of social media. social media has made us interact with new people easier then knocking on their door and talking to them. and you can find people who have similar intersets as you. for example, football, food,  skiing. news is a key thing,  social media  is easy for us people to spread news across the globe, with breaking news,  tweets receiving thousands of retweets in minutes. social medias disadvantages are  reclase. wars are starting from social media countries are spreading hate for other countries wich leads to civilians answering the hate and talking back with hate.  that is what makes it bad.
Social media plays a huge role in society, as it is extremely powerful. Everyone is able to use their voice when it comes to social media, one can even share their thoughts anonomously. Social media has helped solve multiple issues, from finding solutions for unjust consequences to giving people new oppourtinities. For instance, just recently, a worker who cleans cars outdoors in Dubai was dancing and looked content. A guy was astonished by his positive attitude towards his job and filmed him dancing and posted it on Twitter. Not long after, the video went viral. People found out more information about him and it turned out that the man has a Bachelor's degree. Given that reason, the man was offered many better jobs. He accepted the one that was  best for him and his life has changed drastically to the better because of that. In addition, there were many problems occcuring in Sudan that people did not know about due to the silence of the news. One girl was couragous enough to post a video on Instagram and Twitter explaining what is happening to her country. The video spread very quickly and people started taking actions to help. In fact, people and even celebrities from all over the world changed their profile picture in socail media to dark blue to spread awareness. Many improvements have been happening ever since and many countries volunteered to help solve the issue.
The UAE is a place were people tries their best to be at the top point, it is a place where people share there skills to make things done and accomplish their goals. In this country we are developing by the guidance of our rulers. As one of the UAE citizen we are so proud of our several processes that we went through and helped us to make our dream come true and since this happened we our very proud of ourself and our prominent leaders. One of the most developments that was surly   important is Dubai the city that fascinates people inside and outside the country. Dubai was a dessert and know it is a city full of buildings and technological places that makes everyone amazed, actually the tallest building is in the heart of the UAE (Dubai). This is why Dubai is such an important development by the UAE. Dubai increased the percentage of tourists and made people live in a life that suits their needs and wants.In  conclusion, there are a lot of developments in the UAE, but Dubai was one of the most important developments that made a positive difference, as  know Dubai is welcoming millions of people and more than 100 countries in the occasion of EXPO 2020, which will impact the UAE economy in a positive way.
How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media has a very big impact on the people in our society. In the old times, when families choose to go out to eat together, they would enjoy every minute of it because they interact with one and other and get to know each other more. Nowadays people cant go out to eat without taking a picture of their food first and posting it online, whether its  instagram or snapchat or even twitter. They tend to feel the need to go online every couple of minutes and forget that they are eating together because they are too busy with their social lives rather than their real ones. Social media is not intirely negative, it has positive aspects such as communication. People can talk to friends they havent seen in a long time or even friends that graduated with them and still want to keep in touch. However, the negative impact of social media is just sad. It's really dissapointing to see people always on their phones and rarely not using them. When I'm at family gatherings and see everyone just staring at their phones and not communicating with one another I get really emotional, Is social media really making us communicate with people or is it just a distraction that takes us away from our real lives and   enter fake ones where people comment nice things on each others posts when in reality they dont stand each other. Social media affects individuals in many ways, a person could be popular onilne but have no friends or  could be famous yet feel so lonely. Everyone has social media, but how and why you use social media is in your hands. In conclusion, Social media is a nice way to communicate with others and make new friends, but there are bounderies and certain times where people should not always use their phones to go on social media. People should restrict themselves and think more about their real lives rather than their online ones.
Many people use social media in the wrong way which affects individuals and society in various ways. Using social media for blackmail, exposing others, or faking to be someone else (cat fishing) is a common thing in our society nowadays and should be stopped due to many individuals getting hurt. It is mainly used by the teenagers which causes other teenagers to feel depressed and eventually wanting to commit suicide, which then affects the family of that person. Children under the age of 10 also have access to social media and  are not mature enough to stop themselves from talking to strangers and sharing personal information about themselves and their family. If you use it the wrong way, other people would think that its okay and will be motivated to do the same and by time it would spread and hurt our community. There are many ways you can use social media in the right way, such as, communicating with family and friends outside the country, ordering stuff online, and finding out information about items. Spending so much time on social media and not knowing anything about the outside life would destroy you as  person and it will affect you because you're going to be so naive about the life you're living in. In conclusion, the less social media is used, the better our community would be.
c. How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media has a lot of influncers including singers, politicians, and models. It has both negative and positive impact on people using it. Viewing negative behavior such as crime constantly be looked down upon helps people remember the norm and avoid participating in deviant behavior. It can also be very unhealthy by making people feel less worthy, its a huge platform this gives an advantage to brands who want to sell their products by using influncers and big personalities to show case their product,  due to this individuals feel the need to fit in and that helps the brand gain success. Social media has influnced societies by changing the norm and accepting new cultures and traditions. For example, the U.A.E is a muslim country therefore we celebrate holidays that are mentioned in the Quran however now during Christmas the U.A.E helps residents feel welcomed by setting up Christmas decorations. Personally, I think social media can be used to spread awareness about a lot of problems we are facing today and help cause a change.
Social media can affect as in a bad and good way, both ways can make us learn from our mistakes or do mistakes even more,  social media has it own advantages and disadvantages. To talk about the advantages of social media is that it gains our personal knowledge,  help us to communicate  others all over the world and be more social towards everyone. in a more good way social media affects individuals and society by making them know more about life, for example  business poeple or for the people who work in a society that social media is more wanted to spread the news about the company or to spread commercials. From the bright side it teaches us to build our self comfidence for those who are shy and not able to talk publicly. However, social media can affect us in a more bad way,  a way that can lead the society into darkness and harm. for example when there is something going on  twitter that a person talked about and gave their opinion to it, hundreds of people share their own opinion  a rude and bad way.  When s child is abusing their own family and does not give respect because of social media. Videos can be published in a bad way to ruin a repetation or even worse. In my point of view their are people who can control their social media life in a good way, some of them choose the bad way and some just go with the goods.
how do social media affect the individuals and society? Social media has a huge affect on the difierent generations in our society. It has many ups and downs and different dangers and advantages, so that is why you always have to be careful with how you use these platforms. there are disadvantages like cyber bullying and scams, but on the other hand it has many advantages like business growth and easier connection to people.

Secondly, the advantages of social media are huge. Businesses have prospered with the help of social media, because social media helps to connect many to one another, and since it does that it opens doors to  alot of diversity amon 
How do Social Media affect individuals and society? Ayesha Marwan Al-Mehairi Social Media is a modern platform that can be used in different ways, it can be used for entertainment purposes or even educational.  For years, scientists have been researching whether Social Media affects individuals and society or whether it doesn't affect them at all. Here are a couple of reasons why I believe Social Media affects individuals and society. Firstly, famous people who use social media affect the way the viewer (the person who is watching the famous person) thinks. The viewer in most chances gets influenced by the actions done by the famous person, and the actions affect society as its being applied in the real world and not just the internet (social media in that case). Secondly, it physically affects them in a way that they get convinced to do the same things that famous people do. For instance, there was the """" Kiki, do you love me? """" challenge and thousands have participated. This simply proves that thousands, or even millions of people get affected by social media. Lastly, it is the most common way of communicating in the modern days. Research has proved that documents sent by literal mail isn't being used as much as it used to  back in the 80s and 90s. The modern """mail""" is social media, which is sending messages to loved ones. Documents are sent by email nowadays. Again, I personally believe that social media affects individuals and society and I hope the reasons that I applied above convinces you as a reader that social media does affect people.
In our generation, people  and mostly the younger ones  use social media more than communicating with people around them. The social media has a huge impact on each and every individual. It all depends on how they use it in their daily lives. Many users benefit  alot from it while others do not. For example, many people follow these influencers that might help them be more confident about themselves such as how to communicate with others or what is trending now whether its in fashion or some delicious food recipes. However, the younger ones get influenced by them in a different way that it might do them harm instead of helping them. For instance, if a kid watches videos on youtube of people doing illegal activities such as, ruining the government properties or destroying someone's belonging as a form of entertainment, this kid might do the exact same behaivior which will lead to parents punishing the child for these mad behaiviors. Social media and social media influencers should have an great impact and be a way of guiding people to do better in their lives. Parents should be more careful about how their kids use the social media for communicating instead of communicating with people around them.
Addiction Social media is a platform that holds many things for everyone, and many people see it as something very valuable to them. However social media has such a huge affect on our society, apps like instagram, snapchat, twitter and facebook are used by almost all of us and we are addicted to those apps. Many men and women are affected by what is spread through social media about how you should look and what is considered beautiful and what is considered masculne which puts them in a state of depression which can give them sucidel thoughts, as well as eating disorders since many women follow the trends on social media on how their body should look like and what is an ideal body , in addition to men who use steroids to gain muscle since it is considred attractive and shows a sense of masculinity. Also teenagers getting bullied and harassed on social media is not a surprise, many users would bully younger girls on how they looked, how their hair looks or their makeup and this has various effects on teens because they see how they look  something important and if it is not  in the standards of what social media wants they get bullied online which lowers their self confidence. Harassment is also another thing that effects a majority of women, when users comment on their posts  and usually they are not very friendly and  are outragoues comments which makes women and younger girls feel vurnable in their own socail media platform. In conclusion, socail media has such a big impact on everyone and has many disadvantanges and does not have a good side. It changes people and turns them to people who are obssesed on how they look and what they have and the shape of their body and if they fit on or not. In the end these are all just opinions from people and everyone is amazing in their own way and no one has to follow anything to fit in.
Social media plays an important part in human's life. It can be used to connect and communicate with people from all around the world in just simple - short steps. There are also several usages for social media other than communicating with people. Social media can effect us and our society in many different ways,  mentally and physically. As individuals, our priority is to have our cell phones and to access to our social media applications to capture our special moments and share  it to the world. Many others use them as a way to gain more money by advertising their businesses etc. Social media can effect people's mental health if it is used in a wrong way, such as when someone would use it all day long without living the moment and enjoying it. Moreover, having social media can open you to many different types of comments which might also include negative comments which will result to making you feel horrible about yourself. However, It effects the society in both  positive  or negative way.  Positive such  influencers who have a great impact on the society and help them in many different ways.  Negative such as bad comments or bad content that might disturb the viewers or leave a bad impact on them. In conclusion, social media will always be a spectacular addition to human living in several types and ways. Being able to go around the world,  getting introduced to different perspectives just by using social media is fasicanting and amazing.
social media has become a big part of our life now a days. The media helps connect different type of people from around the world together, that can be a positive thing for  alot of people. Especially for people who conduct different studies around the world and want to share them with the rest of the population. social media offers most people a plat form to start their careers in and to help them rise to fame and make them more known to the rest of the world. Society can come together and help  eachother out through using social media and help raise awarness about the problems and difficults and try to start somewhere to solve the promblem. Indidviduals can be either positively effected or negatively effected by the media,  positively; like finding support groups or following people the effect their life in a good way and help them change for the best.  Negatively, can be by spreading hate towards a person or a group of people. It can also be by carrying out dangerous activities and streaming them online for viewers to see and mostly younger viewers of the media are most likely to be influenced and drawn to such bad or illegal activity which can put them in a higher risk of falling in trouble with the law or even their parents. All in all social media can be a bad place and a good place for users to enjoy, its just how you chose to use it  can effect you, and the people that surround you.

How do social media affect individuals and society? Social media or as our elders call it """trash""," has had a very big impact in todays society as it has played a big role by enlightining people to other cultures that are different from their own, which has created a more friendlier and peacful enviroment. However social media's ihas had its negative impacts as it disattached people from reality and made face to face intracrions feel weird and awkard, as if social media alienated human interactions. There  also people who say that social media helped individuals from different backgrounds to meet  eachother and destroy the barreir that was between them. Social media has also destroyed several steryotypes that people were fed by the mainstream media which helped people get a better understanding of other cultures. Social media has also served as a outlet for people who are interverted and helped them with the transition into finally becoming exterverts. In conclusion, as every new invention there are postives and negative but I think that social media's postives exceeds its negatives and it has helped way more that it has harmed.So  people should stop concerining themselves with whats wrong with  and start focusing on how to improve it.
How do social media affect individuals and society ? Nowadays, communication has become much faster and easier compared to 20 years ago for instance , and one of the biggest differences were caused by social media networks.Social  media allows us to communicate and share pictures or videos and a lot of other things qucikly and it requires no effort at all  ,one click could send a huge amount of data . In the other hand, as we all know that everyhting has pros and cons to it , and that applies to social media sites  too.Don't get me wrong those networks are useful if you need to look for information , or if you miss somone across the globe and you want to communcate with them.But,  those applications can be so dangerous if they are used by the wrong individuals or used with bad intentions, for example children younger than 10 in my opinion are too innocent and immatre for the ideas and the content that is provided in those sites.Social  media also causes some health issues such as damage to eye sight, pain in the hands, or back and neck pain , alongside with the bad influence to the young users such as strict beauty standards,bad  language , and more. Those networks do not only affect individuals , but it also can affect the society in a variety of  ways.Social media can break close friendships, relationships, and unfortunately famlies, because it could limit face-to-face communication and physical touch too.It  also may be a huge cause of lazyness and the decrease in productivity waether it is a student or an employee. Social media is not harmful unless you use it carefully and with the right intentions.
When was the last time you checked one of your social media accounts? It must be recently. Most of us uses social media nowdays, some of us are even obssesed with it. Social media is what makes us connected to the world, we reach whatever we want with one finger press. Social media has may effects in our life, some of them are postive while others are negative. From my point of view, I see that it depends on the way we use it . Social media made our life easier, you can contact with people all around the world by texting or video calls using different applications like : FaceTime . It was never easy before to see somone who lives far away from you in such a way. Parents can stay connected to their children who study abroad,  friend can keep in touch with each other. By using social media you can express your thoughts and feelings, and find people who share the same thoughts as you. It is easy to have some disscutions and exchange opinions in social media accounts such as Twitter. I think social media brought the society closer. On the other hand, social media can become a bad idea if we did not use it in a proper way . Younger people may use their social media account to bully their collegues and this will cause problems for both sides. In addition, if we kept using social media all the time, we may become less social and might have some health problems. Social media was made to keep us communicated, so we should not use  and forget the real life realtionships. Social media is a great method and  neccary in the moder world, we should use it wisely to improve our selfes and our society.
All of us know that social media affect on everything in a bad way and in a good way as well, it affects groups, individuals and society as well.

There is many actually, first of all it helps people to know new people around the world , people with  new culture and attitude. Second, there is many volunteering groups and activities in our country, how do we know about that ? Social media is the main introducer of those activities, we can know the name of the activity, the day and date, time of the activity, how many volunteers the need, and are the needed volunteers are males or females, that is amazing !! . Then, there are many people  had there own business ideas so the social media is the best way to introduce there work and ideas to people actually with the new update as well ( Highlight ) they can put there prices, there ideas and everything. Last but not least, there are many people around the world who can give us some advices about many things, people who went through a lot of experiences and they have learned from this experience, the pass the lesson to others that is useful actually, we learn from them and we pass the informations to others,  to our family and friends. Last, there is a lot of acounts on social media that teach you how to cook, that is amazing you lears while you are in home. At the end I would like to end my paragraph with an advice, use social media for benefits, let the world be a better place because of us. Thank you
Nowadays, we can not say that we are controling our life. The fact is totally different. Our life is controlled by how people seeing us. We just act the way that they want us to and we forget to be ourselves. We are acting and showing our behaviours to other people by using social media. But in the same time some people get the real benefit from these social media and improve there selves. So, social media is a two-sided sword and depend on which side you are using it will affects our life. For most of us. Social media made the world a small village. We can contact with diverse people. Either from the south or from the north. It becomes easier for us to understand how other people think. Or instead of doing exceptions about the people who are  farway from us, we easily connect with them. Social media becomes a strong platfrom to share your ideas and let your voice to be heard. Now, we can talk about our rights or support other nations to get their heard. Sharing information, documents, pictures or even reports and news is available now!. Social media made the nation much developed. It is easy now for people to study and learn new languages. As a result, this is can improves the country's economy and will let the country get a lot of knoweldege. As we mentioned before that social media is a two-sided sword. It can affects our life in  oppostie way and runied our relastionship with others. The number of cyber bullying is getting higher than ever before. People who are suffering from back pain and eayes vision  rising more quickly. It is extremely danger that we have been no longer close to our family. All these individuals affects can have a consequences to our society. People  getting lazy and just want to be on their phones. The number of workers who are focused  get lower than ever before. In my opinion. Depend on how we use social media it will affects us. Either in  good way  by using the advantages in the right way  or the bad way which is let the social  enter our life and control ourselves instead of we have to control them.
individuals and society Social media in knowdays are all around the world. People can easily get connected to others by just entering a application such as: Whatsapp, snapchat, or instagram. The social media have some positive and negative affects on both individuals and society. It depends on how the person is using the application. Social media has a positive affects on individuals when they are using it for education maybe such as making research, or gathering information through chating with other people who are realted to the topic they are making the research on. It can also be positive when they use it to watch people who are there to support people and gives them some instructions that makes their lives better. Social media has a positive affects on the society when all people maybe are connected in a whatsapp group, and they share ideas or videos that has some content that give people some ways in their life to be better, or somethings that may aware them  from thing, such as: A virus that is spreaded in a link or  program. Social media will have a negative affect on the individuals and society when they will be using it in a wrong way. When kids will be spending time on social media to just watch videos such as how to play a currtain game, or how to make  prank or activities, this will be a negative affect on the individuals because some of them have an addict to these programs, so they will not care about their education and homeworks. When individuals use social media to contact with other people who spread negativity between them, this is a bad affects. I see that the biggest bad affect that the social media made in the society is that people do not bother to see or meet each other anymore, they always prefer to stay at home and use the social media programs to contact with each other. The other negative affect is that when people are sat together in a coffee shop maybe or  family gathering, all of them are playing with their phones, and forgeting that they are all sat together, and this makes the old people angry because their kids dont bother to talk with them,  they are only playing with their phones. According to my personal information, i see that social media affects people depending on the way they use it. Parents should always check on their kids on how they are using the programs, just to make a better society that spreads postivity.
Starting of  United Arab Emirates has always been a developed country although in the past they didn't have those ideas about building towers and malls, they were mostly just using camels for transportation and for feeding them self. Today  United Arab Emirates is probably one of the most developed countries, going from its fancy restaurants that are located in high places to see spectacular views and moving on to the different roads that have been created through out the years. Where as in the city called Dubai, it is famous for its very tall towers and how it has been build and lots more. Yet these ideas have come from different religions and countries and have probably combined all of their unique and great ideas together where thats one of the reasons why the United Arab Emirates has developed so fast and in an intelligent way. Another reason is from how much population came in to the country from different countries, it made the country better and wider till this very moment,  UAE is still willing to come up with more of great minds to have a great outcome and a safer place for others. In conclusion,  UAE would love to come up with more and would build more through out the years, and the more great minds of people    that have unique and ideas that would actually do something great for this world at any nationality are most welcomed to share it with us today.
Social media affects Social media plays a big role in these days, and it affect our life in many different ways. We live in  days where everything works with technology and we are so attached to it that we think that we cannot live our life without it,  but not really and the fact  that we did not understand yet the how effective it is on our mental and physical health. Social media is a part of our life it is the place where we can find the news and the new developments that that reached us recently, as a person who use social media I can see how it is important in my life because I cannot wake in the morning without checking my social media and check what is going around me. The social media had replaced the paper news because we can know everything immediately from the social media, I personally i do not go out often because it is easier to me to contact other from the social media, and i think it is  bad habit because we do not move much which affect our health like: having  lack of vitemens, obesity and lack of social communication in real life. People should use social media but not too much because when you spend a lot of your time on social media it sometimes get more like  addiction where some people do suiced  from this addiction. I think we should get used to not use social media a lot and live our life and live more freely because in my opinion social media is like a prison to our souls.
Social media is a huge gate to transfer to virtual life, its a big communitiy include mixed religons from all around the world. As we all know we are using social media applications to connect with others to chat and share our routine on different ways, Everything in this world have two sides good affects and bad affects so it depends on how we deal with it , Nowdays social media apps are a good getway to explore the world like other cultures or new friendships could change our lifestyle, or we can find people or groups  have the same intrest we have. Even there is affects on the society. these days social medie became  a such famous way to brodcast any informations or newsletters and thats a good way to make the communitiy knows about whats happening around the world, Making  new opportunitiy for wh searching for a job in both sectors private or goverment. In my opinon, if we used the social media in a good way its will reflect on us in a good way too , so being respectful to others on these gatways are so important to build a good relationships.
( Social media ) Who doesn't own social meadia accounts nowdays? I think that it is one of the most important issues these days ! Everyone use it as an everyday routine, either adults, kids or teenagers .. As you know social media can affect us in so many different ways , it has a lot of advantages on each society, first, it is the best way to communicate with your friends and family, it can save a lot of time and money instead of using phone calls or visiting them. Next, you can get some new knowledge by looking to other countries cultures from posts that people share from all around the world ! also you can learn new languages by getting new friends from different countries. finally it made our life much easier ! with social media you can know about online shopping applications or websites so you can shop when you are at home ! no need to go to malls or shopping centers. There are much more advantages about social media that you can find and explore by yourself.. on the other hand, of course it has to be some disadvantages about social media applications, one of the biggest disadvantages is the less amount of moving ! some of us can sit with thier phones checking Instagram, snapchat, twitter and facebook .. for a lot of time ! it could take between 3-6 hours daily !. Also wastng time is a big issue too, we can cancel some of our important daily plans or work only to stay online with friends or family, another thing that we suffer from   social media is lack of sleep ! sleep hours become lesser after using social media, we stay up all night only to be connected to the world for 24 hours! In conclusion social media is a good thing to our society when we manage it in the right way, otherwise it's too harmful to us..
There is no doubt that social media is becoming increasly imortant in todays wold.its  one of the most imprortant ways to contact with the others , there is a big role for social media in our life, and every thing in our lives has an impact  individuals and society but there is a good side and  bad side. its commonly know that social media is useful for most of the people, but i have and you have to know how to use it in a good way because this may affect in the others for instance the famouse girls they have  very healthy life style and perfect bady and skin so when the adult or womens saw like that they will try to be  same  this girl but they dont know that she have  different life behind the screen she's actully not showing her whole life so we dont know about her problems , only what we know that she have an amazing life and skin , i think also social media make the person go away from his life  make him busy and lazy to do the works only you can manage this. On the other hand, i claim that social media have more positive sides, from social media the peopla can exchange of experience and that make the society developed , also social media help us and motivate us to bring out our talent and its a good chance to know our talent and help our country to be in  first positions. In the end, there is bad thing and good things for every thing so you have to choose your way that you want.
The UAE has develpoed a lot at the past few years, espicially in Dubai and soon there will be many more development. All around the world people are waiting for Expo 2020 because of the many other changes that will be in Dubai and maybe on the othe emirates.  UAE is that kind of  countries that can develope very easly, many companies like EMMAR can post things about  UAE culture on instagram, snapchat, twiter, and other social media because now days like 5% of people who don't use social media so it's so easy to know about every country culture on  internet. I think that if some people traveled through a travel agency and introduce our culture outside. You can also shot a vedio and upload it on youe on youtube channle so that meny youtube users watch it and learn something about us  but something good and deserve wasting sometimes by watching it, because many people film somthing useless no need for it. our government can also check the contenet before the people upload or post anything. I think that the most iportant development was and will be is Expo 2020 I can't wait for that time I know many beautiful things will be shown and I hope I get a chance to inter.
the internet , social media is a huge amount of websites that conects people to each other worldwide , starting from families and frindes to huge facilities and workshops however the internet has made a huge changes   pass 50 to 60 years in this pargraph we will be talking about social media in sepicifec ways and how does it effect the individuals and the society.in  my opinion i think that social media is effecting the society and the individuals in a wrong way , because a lot of people keep comparing between what they have and what others has , so it makes them feel unsatesfayed for what they have and ungratefull too , so it leads them to keep spending a lot of money on selly stuff just for shows and thats wrong .Some people might say No social media can be good too , well yes in some ways social media can help people to be more social and to communicate with each other such as talking to a friend at America while youre  at UAE , or to get works done so yeah social media has it positives and negatives , it actully depends on how much time you spend on social media and how  good can you control yourself .
Social media has affected  ourlives in an unbeliveable way, it became an important thing in our daily life. And i think that it helps us sometimes to get throw many things in our day. I think that social media has some affects on society and individuals. First, the affects of the social media on individuals are  alot, it may have affects  your eyes, it makes some people less social in real life but in the social media they have a different personality and it my affect your relationships because sometimes when we talk in real  is better to understand each other more. Secondly, there are lots of affects on the society which having problems with family which can be a negative affect on the society, people will lose there communication with each other and some kids may be irresponsible to their parents or relatives which can also be affectd. In conclution, social media has  alot of impact  to ourlives which can be on individual or on the society, we can help each other to get over the negative affects by having a connection between you and your relatives and friens in real life  not by our phones  and make this connection srtonger.
