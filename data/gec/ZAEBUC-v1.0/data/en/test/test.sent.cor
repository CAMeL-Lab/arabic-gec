Social media has advantages and  disadvantages that can affect  our society.  Nowadays, people read their news on the social media, and they learn; also, social media has a bad effect on people and children. Children learn from celebrities; people learn from each other. 
Social media is one of the major things in the world right now; it has helped a lot of people, and it has a lot of information about almost everything. For example, most of the news is on social media more than in newspapers, and it shows us things that are not on television, and they stay on social media forever. Everything has a positive and a negative; social media's positive effect is that it helps individuals and society; the way that it helps society is that it contains breaking news,  election polls or even live events about the election, which, of course, helps people understand what's going on. The way that it helps individuals is that they can promote themselves with cooking, politics and just by talking about anything, in their opinion. The negative effect of social media on society is that it sometimes contains rumors or lies that ruin one's mind or change one's thinking; it can cause a cyberwar  between countries or even an actual war, while the negative effect of social media on individuals is so bad that some people suicide because of the talks and hate on social media. In my opinion, social media is not more useful  than it's useful, and it brought a lot of problems to the world.
Social media is the most effective around the world. These days, some people can't stay a moment without checking their phones to see what happened around the world on social media. However, social media affects  people's lives on many sides (could be positively or negatively), such as their personality and their jobs. Social media can affect  people's personalities in a negative way. People can't respect and accept anything around them, they always want more and they don't like small things. For instance, people look at their gifts before the person  brings the gift; they lose the meaning of the gift. On the other hand, social media sometimes helps people by encouraging and pushing them to complete their education (for people who didn't complete it yet). For example, they can see one of the bloggers talk about their passion for their jobs after they  did their degree. There are a lot of people who don't accept any kind of job because they see that it's not appropriate for them, so they stay at home without a job. Social media gives them unreal examples of people who have big houses and sports cars, so they won't like them, no less. That means people will be unemployed,  so the government suffers because there are no workers and no sources. To sum up, people and society decide how social media affects their lives positively or negatively. It can affect their jobs and their personality in several ways.
Social media is one of the biggest intersections that we all face on a daily basis. It has its pros and cons for society and individuals. I believe that social media affects people's   way of thinking and how they perceive it; some people know not to believe everything they see online, while others tend to believe just about everything they read. Social media and society don't mix well all the time, and that causes a lot of chaos and enormous destruction to a person's thinking style because society and social media intertwine greatly when it comes to huge topics, like politics, diversity and anything that could make a person want to speak up about in this age and time. On the other hand, some pros of how social media affects society are that it somehow brings us all together in a way even if it's a small community. Social media benefits our society to do much greater things, and we discover a lot by just checking the Internet alone. It can provide us with all of the information an individual needs on a daily basis, and I believe that helps the society as much as it would help one person alone.
Today, as we all know, social media has reached up to that limit where you can find anyone; you can know about everything and can gain knowledge related to anything. It's good to keep us updated with what's going on in the world, but with all these benefits of social media, there are a lot of bad things and criminal activities that might take place. The first disadvantage is  hacking; anyone's personal data can be easily hacked if not properly secured and can be shared all over the Internet. The hacker may misuse their private property. Hacking is known as an illegal activity. The other disadvantage is addiction;  nowadays, teenagers and even kids are getting so much into social media that they can be termed as addicted. Addiction is a bad thing and can easily ruin someone's personal life.
The social media  has many effects on the people; it has a good effect and a bad effect;  the good effect of the social media  is communicating with all the people in the world and learning a new thing about  life. I  see that the social media   has a big effect on the Internet; it can change the individuals and society.  The social media  has more bad things, the same as some not good news, and some people use it in a bad way  to kill people and take money, but it's not a good way; also, many kids games in this time  need an  account on social media to play them,  and on this account, there may be some bad people from whom the kids learn bad things, and some kids  kill their family because they told them that.  In my opinion, the social media has the same effect on individuals and society, and it keeps people making some bad things.
In these days,  social media has many advantages and disadvantages and affects us negatively and positively. Social media is the apps through which we connect with each other from different places, such as Snapchat,   WhatsApp, Instagram and so on. Social media affects the individual person in two ways. First, on the positive side,  it keeps them following the  famous person and also  knowing  new information; however, they can contact with their friends in  another country. On the other side, it can affect them negatively; for example, they can trust who is talking to them; also, using social media too much will affect their relationship  with their family because they will use it so much, and they will not sit with their family.  On the other hand, social media can affect the society in two ways. First, it will benefit the community on many sides, for example,  the important news;  all the community will know what happened in their country, and it can support their talent by posting their    work or what they did on social media; but sometimes,  it is not a good way to talk or communicate because some kind of the community will not use it in a good way. For example, they will sell  bad products; also, the relationships  are not real at all. In the end, I wish to try not to  use social media too much not to  affect us negatively. 
Social media is programs or apps that help people to communicate with each other and find the world's news or what's happening. Social media today is so important because people can call their friends or family if they were far from them. These apps can affect - positively or negatively - individuals and society. For example, people may affect  their health in bad ways; like they like to sit alone the whole time and don't like to share anything or talk to anyone. That affects society a lot;   people won't waste their time on good things, like learning new things and having new information. On the other hand, it can affect positively  the person and society. Social media helps people to read or watch new information. For example, students can have information for their work, and also people can improve their level of education by reading online or watching videos. Social media has two sides, but it depends on the person - whether he/she uses it in the right way. It affects a person and society a lot in a bad way or in a good way.
In these days, the  social media has many effects on our life.  Some people can't live without social media.  On the other hand,  most of the jobs  prefer to use the emails.  The social media has many effects on our life; some of them are advantages, and some of them are disadvantages.  I will begin with the disadvantages.  Firstly,  some of them use it in a bad way; they do something  bad for the government or for the country.  Secondly,  some of them use it like most of their day, and they do not sit with their family.  Finally,   most of the accidents    come from the social media; they see the mobile and do not care about anyone.   There are many advantages in our life.  Firstly,  some of the people study outside  the country, so they contact with their family on the social media, so they will contact their family.  Secondly,  when you  have any problem, you will know how to contact with other people to know you have a problem.  Finally,  that will provide information, knowledge and learning.  To sum up,  that will be very important in our life, and it  has advantages and  disadvantages, and everything  in this life has  them. In my opinion, it is very important, and it is an easy way to contact with others. 
 Nowadays,  social media has many effects on individuals and society; it has positive and negative things. First of all, I will begin with the positives of social media. The first positive of social media is the exchange of life experiences in the fields of life. The second positive is to acquire important information from its sources. The next positive is that it gives way to creativity. In addition, it helps us to communicate with other people in the world. Therefore, it helps us to know the news and what's happening in the world. Also, the social media has negative things that affect individuals and society in the world. The first negative of social media is the emotional isolation from nearby  society. The second negative is that there is a strong opportunity to spread and promote rumors. In my opinion, I think that everything  in the world has positive and negative things, so social media has negative things more than positive things; it helps us to communicate with other people and helps us to know the news.
Social media has a bad effect on our communities. It makes people  alone. Most people prefer to be at home to watch movies  with their friends on social media, and that makes them only connect  together on social media, and this makes people only connected  together by social media. Because of social media, people don't see each other face to face, and this makes a bad effect on our community. People should   use social media less to have a lovely community and a happy community.
Nowadays, the rate of the fire accidents in buildings is decreased because of the safe society.  Each room in the buildings or the houses has a fire notification, and there is equipment to turn off the fire and first aid on all the floors. In another hand, also the street has to save society by the rules to organize cars and  walkers and put cameras on every single street to help and take evidence of car or street accidents. The UAE government develops the buildings and the houses to save people and include life.
Social media has two sides:  good, bad, safe and dangerous.  It depends on how we use it and on our interests too. I believe that lately, social media has been affecting individuals and society in such a bad way, not because of social media itself; it's because of the people using these apps. For example, let's give a look at people using social media 8 years ago;  even when they used to use social media,  they used to talk and sit with their families and talk more, but now, all we care about is chatting on our phones. Also,  it was all safe and a fun place, but now, they are all using it as a way to spread hate against a person or spread hate against countries, and all of which is not good at all; also, it's not a human being's behavior. To be honest, I can't deny that social media has a good side too,  for example, reaching our families and friends who live in other countries,  knowing about important news and much more. I trust that nothing ruined the social media more than the toxic people behind the screen because if they weren't there,  none of this would happen. Thank you.
Nowadays, social media is such a popular thing around the world, and everyone uses it to communicate with their friends and family. There are many negative and positive uses of the phone; the positive things of social media are that we have the ability to talk with everyone, such as a call or a video call; we can study on the phone,  do research to discover new information and have  enough knowledge about something; also, there are many apps that help the children to learn and play games. However, there are also negative effects on the one who uses the phone for  bad things, such as wasting time on apps that are not important at all, playing,  saying bad words to anyone on social media and posting videos and pictures that are not allowed for children to watch; in addition, when someone becomes educated on social media, they  don't listen, and their attention is only on their phone; they don't know what is going on around them, and that is not a good behavior at all.
Social media effects These days, the social media is taking  huge attention even if that will affect our  lifestyle. Adults and  children have a bad use for the social media, and they  sit on their social media accounts for hours. Furthermore, there are many effects of using social media; for example, people become  fatter and lazier, and they do not play sports, whereas there are some people who are using the social media in a good  way, such as a business way, or they share their healthy  lifestyle with us. I prefer to live in the social media life because I learned the English language, and it's easy to contact with my family in KSA.
The UAE is a developed country. The ruler of the UAE always wants his country to be the number one in everything. Nowadays, the UAE has many achievements. The UAE supports all people to create new things to help the country to develop and come the number one - not just in our region, but  around the world. We should  be loyal to our county and let the name of our country come up. The most development in the UAE is the Expo 2020 in this year. Expo 2020 is an important thing in the UAE for many reasons. The first reason why it's important is because it's the first time in the Middle East, it includes all countries around the world and it's about the future. The second most important development in the UAE is Masdar City in Abu Dhabi. It works on solar plant energy, so it's important to protect our environment. It's the first city to work on solar power. The UAE still works to develop more than before. The UAE - our country - helps us to create more things to come up. Thanks to the UAE for helping us to become a developed country, and it helps us to live a nice life. The UAE is developing the education, and now we have knowledge, so it affects  us and makes the life easy for us.
 How does social media affect individuals and society?  Social media is a tricky subject. It has a lot of negatives yet a lot of positives. It was created as an easy way for people to communicate and interact with each other. Somehow, it became a battle of who has more followers or who gets the most likes. To unfollow can be considered rude, or it can be taken as an insult. A like means they have a romantic interest. A retweet is like being asked on a date, and so on. It takes up  so much of teenagers' and young adults' lives. Yet it is also  a way to find news, share your own thoughts and experiences with people and make new friends. Though, I have realized from my personal experience that people who get too invested in social media tend to shut out humans from their surroundings. They focus solely on the social media friends until they realize that they should have been more attentive. Sometimes, it's okay to put your phone down and go talk to your mother. It's okay to read a book, go for a walk, draw and unplug. And be careful whom you trust on the Internet.
One of the most important things  nowadays is social media.  It has many positive and negative effects on individuals and society, such as decreasing the time and making the human connection less than before.  I'll show some details below.  One of the positive effects is decreasing the time to connect with the others at work or with family and  friends,  so you don't have to plan to have a long ride to get some information from someone for the work.  One more thing is you can talk with your friends all the time and wherever  and whenever you want to have a call or a chat with them,  so that's one of the benefits of the social media and a positive effect on individuals and community.  On the other hand,  the effect of the social media on individuals and society  makes the human connection less than before  because  the lazy people, or most of the people, use the social media to chat with the others even if they are in the same place, so that makes the human connection less than before.  Finally,  the social media is a good way to connect with the others, but we must know  how to use it in the right way to keep it on our side and  get the benefit from it. 
The social media  affects individuals and society. However, it impacts  our health when we use the social media every time. Also, it impacts the communication with other people.  In this essay, I will talk about how  social media affects individuals and society. First of all, it  has some effects.  For example, when you use social chat after you see the humans in  any place, you can communicate with them the same as in the social chat.  Also, it impacts  our health when we use the phone too much. We should use it sometimes, but     not all the time;    and we have a big problem with the children who use social media because they can chat with anyone, and this thing will be  very dangerous for the children. Families should   see what their children   do when they play on the phone and who is talking with them on the social media;  but sometimes, when  used, for example, in the night, the phone closes automatically. This is a good thing to save our    children's health. Secondly, we also  have a good thing when we use the social media.  For example, you can chat very fast with any people in a short time. Also, if you have a problem at your university, you can use the social media, using the email, to communicate with your teacher and write your problem, and he will give you the solutions to the problem in a short time. 
In the UAE, they use many kinds of social media for the community, but most  people are using social media, except for teenagers or adults. Let's discuss  what people are using more  between social media and society.  People  use a lot of social media.  For example,   Snapchat, Instagram...... etc. However, some  people  use the society without social media. For example, hang out with friends and talk to your family. In the end, they use the average between social media and society. Furthermore, they use  their career in the future. In my opinion, it depends a lot on people who can  affect their social media and society. Also, it can  affect their future.
All people in the whole   world use the social media. These things have many effects on the individuals and society. People these days are always on their smartphones,  which wastes their time on things that are not necessary. The social media affects individuals in many ways, where they don't give their family some of their time and do not support their children, which will lead them to have a bad grade in their school. This is because their fathers are always on the social media and don't know about them. The second effect is the relationship in the family.  People before the social media  were always together, and each one of them was asking about the other, but in these days,   the social media  affects the society, which will lead to a bad result. In my opinion, social media has some positive effects and negative effects. The positive effect is that people can learn new things about life on the social media. The negative effect is that the social media can damage the people in many ways that they won't have a result to solve these problems.
I think the most important development in the UAE at the moment is the technology  because now and in the future, everything will depend on the technology:  schools, universities,  government places and hospitals.  All of these places now depend on technology because the technology is the future of the country.  The government spends a lot of money on the schools because of the laptops,  labs,  iPads and computers, and the same is for universities.  For hospitals, the government buys for each hospital beds, surgery machines and foods. Now for the government places - for example, police stations or army bases,  the government provides  modern and expensive cars,  modern guns,  modern tanks and modern planes.  Because of that reason, I think the technology is the most important development in the UAE.
Social media has shown a big effect on individuals and  society. Starting with individuals, not only teenagers and adults  are using social media but also kids. It became so important for people to check their social media every hour and before going to bed, and it's the first thing to check when waking up. In the old days, people used to visit each other to know what their family or friends are doing, but   nowadays, you can check how your family and friends are doing just by using social media, either through texting or by watching their stories on "Snapchat", "Instagram", etc.... The social media affects  the society, in my opinion, that people started hanging out less, and families don't meet often, but I noticed that it had a positive effect on medical and nutrition awareness; people started knowing what is good and bad for their health since it's easier to contact a doctor through social media. To conclude, social media has a negative and positive effect, but it's helpful for a lot of things, normally.
Social media The world around us has developed in many different and brilliant ways, and because of this development, there's something to live,  sleep and eat with;  it's something that destroys our real-life  communication, and it's called  """social" "media""."   Social media brings the whole  world - from the west side to the north side - to one screen and with one button;  it's such an amazing thing,  but do you know how much this app or thing destroys our relationships and health and steals all the moments from us?  We don't live any moments these days; we just share our food,  places,  homes and selfies around the world, without  taking a breath to just chill and live these precious moments,  and we are suddenly so addicted to this annoying thing without  our consent; and in my opinion, I guess it is an illness that kills our brain cells;  also, on this screen, there are a lot of rumors that may ruin our families,  communities and the whole world.  Can you just imagine a world that is full of rumors,  bad communication and lies?  It's such a big disaster that will distract everything  around us.  Actually, to be more honest and clear, there are a lot of positive and good things about social media, but it depends on how we use it and deal with it;  but unfortunately, mostly everyone has certainly used social media in many wrong ways, and that's what made me so angry with this issue;  but as I said, it depends on how you use and deal with it.  In the end, I just want you to be more educated and responsible in using social media. 
Topic (C). Social media is a method used to socialize with people around the world in different ways. Social media has a broad category and is frequently used nowadays. WhatsApp, Snapchat, Instagram and Facebook are some of the popular examples of social media. Moreover, individuals and societies are impacted positively and negatively by social media, based on the way they're being used. To begin with, social media has a positive impact on the individual. For instance, it helps people get in touch with each other at any time and anywhere at the speed of light. You can do your job and finish your group projects by being in contact with your group members through social media from your own house, without gathering to do it together; this helps save time and other resources, such as car fuel. Furthermore, social media can entertain you in times when you are bored and you have nothing interesting to do. For instance, you can video-call  your friend in your free time and enjoy your break, without wasting your time doing nothing. In addition, social media can impact you negatively by wasting your valuable time in which you can be productive and achieve something. Social media has a positive impact on the society as well. For example, some companies offer you online shopping through social media, such as Instagram, which helps you save time and shop from your location, without wasting your car's fuel and leaving your house while you're not in the mood to. Moreover, governments nowadays spread the news via social media, which is a place where everyone is active, so the news will be seen by almost everyone. In conclusion, social media became an important thing in our lives nowadays, and people can't live without it. Also, it has both positive and negative influences on the individuals and societies in several ways.
What is social media? Social media is a form of networking that occurs through social applications, like Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and many others. Social media can be used for many different reasons, from advertising to simply keeping in touch with friends. Nowadays, social media has become an essential part of people's lives. Different people use social media for a variety of reasons; it can be used to share parts of an individual's life with their friends and get to know different people from around the world; and some companies are able to market their products to potential customers. Though social media might have many positive attributes, it also has a bad side. Social media makes the spread of information faster and more efficient, but it could be used as a weapon to spread false information, and some people that share their lives or photos on social media may be easy targets to predators and bullies. It could affect an individual in a very negative way if they share too much with strangers on social media, and it could also affect society by the spread of false information. I think that despite its negative aspects, social media can be used to influence society in a positive way by helping people get together and helping small companies grow; and another amazing thing that I've witnessed on Twitter is that many people in desperate need of help are able to reach out to each other during hard times, like people in urgent need of medical help, money or finding a missing child. Social media, if used the right way, can be used to better society and its individuals.
Social media affects individuals and society in many different ways as social media has many drawbacks and benefits, some of which I will be considering    in my writing. Social media affects individuals by playing with their emotions as this results in keeping the individual in constant anger,  which may also result in the individual  taking unpredictable actions, which may be dangerous at times and may lead to harming the society. Social media can even lead to suicide as it can be because of problems with online friends that may persuade the individual to go through dangerous situations; and by persuading them to do it otherwise, the online friend may come and attack the individual's parents - that may cause the death of the parents, whereas the benefits of social media can be for research as it makes it easier for students to research for any projects and homework, and it even teaches the students as students can access videos to learn if they have any confusions in some courses, which may lead to making it clear for the student faster. To add on, social media can lead to the individual  making new friends, and the individual can go on social media when bored.
 Social media is one of the best inventions in our society because not only did it upgrade our lifestyle as individuals, but it created an upgrade for all of us, human beings; it altered the way we view ourselves and other people. Take a walk in any place, and you'll find that sixty to seventy percent of people are on their phones clutching as if they're a newborn child. However, before slamming social media and starting to hate on it, we should outline both advantages and disadvantages of social media. Social media has made marketing better with hotels marketing services; it made staying in touch with family and friends easier through the use of social media. Social media has made  interacting with new people easier than knocking on their door and talking to them; and you can find people who have similar interests as you, for example, football, food and skiing. News is a key thing; on social media, it is easy for us, people, to spread news across the globe, with breaking news and tweets receiving thousands of retweets in minutes. Social media disadvantages are that reckless; wars are starting on social media; countries are spreading hate against other countries, which leads to civilians answering the hate and talking back with hate - that is what makes it bad.
Social media plays a huge role in society as it is extremely powerful. Everyone is able to use their voice when it comes to social media; one can even share their thoughts anonymously. Social media has helped solve multiple issues, from finding solutions for unjust consequences to giving people new opportunities. For instance, just recently, a worker who cleans cars outdoors in Dubai was dancing and looked content. A guy was astonished by his positive attitude towards his job and filmed him dancing and posted it on Twitter. Not long after, the video went viral. People found out more information about him, and it turned out that the man has a bachelor's degree. Given that reason, the man was offered many better jobs. He accepted the one that was the best for him, and his life has changed drastically for the better because of that. In addition, there were many problems occurring in Sudan that people did not know about due to the silence of the news. One girl was courageous enough to post a video on Instagram and Twitter explaining what is happening to her country. The video spread very quickly, and people started taking actions to help. In fact, people and even celebrities from all over the world changed their profile picture on social media to dark blue to spread awareness. Many improvements have been happening ever since, and many countries volunteered to help solve the issue.
The UAE is a place where people try their best to be at the top point; it is a place where people share their skills to make things done and accomplish their goals. In this country, we are developing by the guidance of our rulers. As   the UAE citizens, we are so proud of our several processes that we went through and helped us to make our dream come true; and since this happened, we are very proud of ourselves and our prominent leaders. One of the  developments that was surely the most important is Dubai, the city that fascinates people inside and outside the country. Dubai was a desert, and now it is a city full of buildings and technological places that make everyone amazed; actually, the tallest building is in the heart of the UAE (Dubai). This is why Dubai is such an important development by the UAE. Dubai increased the percentage of tourists and made people live  a life that suits their needs and wants. In conclusion, there are a lot of developments in the UAE, but Dubai was one of the most important developments that made a positive difference; as you know, Dubai is welcoming millions of people and more than 100 countries in the occasion of Expo 2020, which will impact the UAE economy in a positive way.
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has a very big impact on the people in our society. In the old times, when families chose to go out to eat together, they would enjoy every minute of it because they interact with one  another and get to know each other more. Nowadays, people can't go out to eat without taking a picture of their food first and posting it online, whether it's on Instagram,  Snapchat or even Twitter. They tend to feel the need to go online every couple of minutes and forget that they are eating together because they are too busy with their social lives rather than their real ones. Social media is not entirely negative; it has positive aspects, such as communication. People can talk to friends they haven't seen in a long time or even friends that graduated with them and still want to keep in touch. However, the negative impact of social media is just sad. It's really disappointing to see people always on their phones and rarely not using them. When I'm at family gatherings and see everyone just staring at their phones and not communicating with one another, I get really emotional. Is social media really making us communicate with people, or is it just a distraction that takes us away from our real lives and makes us enter fake ones, where people comment nice things on each other's posts when, in reality, they don't stand each other? Social media affects individuals in many ways; a person could be popular online but have no friends, or they could be famous yet feel so lonely. Everyone has social media, but how and why you use social media is in your hands. In conclusion, social media is a nice way to communicate with others and make new friends, but there are boundaries and certain times where people should not always use their phones to go on social media. People should restrict themselves and think more about their real lives rather than their online ones.
Many people use social media in the wrong way, which affects individuals and society in various ways. Using social media for blackmailing, exposing others or faking to be someone else  (catfishing) is a common thing in our society nowadays and should be stopped due to many individuals getting hurt. It is mainly used by the teenagers, which causes other teenagers to feel depressed and eventually want to commit suicide, which then affects the family of that person. Children under the age of 10 also have access to social media, and they are not mature enough to stop themselves from talking to strangers and sharing personal information about themselves and their family. If you use it the wrong way, other people would think that it's okay and will be motivated to do the same, and over time, it would spread and hurt our community. There are many ways you can use social media in the right way, such as communicating with family and friends outside the country, ordering stuff online and finding out information about items. Spending so much time on social media and not knowing anything about the outside life would destroy you as a person, and it will affect you because you're going to be so naive about the life you're living.  In conclusion, the less social media is used, the better our community would be.
 How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media has a lot of influencers, including singers, politicians and models. It has both negative and positive impacts on people using it. Viewing negative behavior, such as crime, constantly being looked down upon helps people remember the norm and avoid participating in deviant behavior. It can also be very unhealthy by making people feel less worthy. It's a huge platform; this gives an advantage to brands which want to sell their products by using influencers and big personalities to showcase  their product - because  these individuals feel the need to fit in, and that helps the brand gain success. Social media has influenced societies by changing the norm and accepting new cultures and traditions. For example, the UAE is a Muslim country; therefore, we celebrate holidays that are mentioned in the Quran; however, now during Christmas, the UAE helps residents feel welcomed by setting up Christmas decorations. Personally, I think social media can be used to spread awareness about a lot of problems we are facing today and help cause a change.
Social media can affect us in a bad and good way; both ways can make us learn from our mistakes or do  even more mistakes. Social media has its own advantages and disadvantages. To talk about the advantages of social media,   it gains our personal knowledge and helps us to communicate with others all over the world and be more social towards everyone. In a better  way, social media affects individuals and society by making them know more about life; for example, for business people or for the people who work in a society,  social media is more wanted to spread the news about the company or to spread commercials. On the bright side, it teaches us to build our  self-confidence (for those who are shy and not able to talk publicly). However, social media can affect us in a worse  way - a way that can lead the society into darkness and harm; for example, when there is something going on on Twitter that a person talked about and gave their opinion  of, hundreds of people share their own opinion in a rude and bad way, and when a child is abusing their own family and does not give respect because of social media. Videos can be published in a bad way to ruin a reputation or even worse. In my point of view, there are people who can control their social media life in a good way; some of them choose the bad way, and some just go with the goods.
How does social media affect  individuals and society? Social media has a huge effect on the different generations in our society. It has many ups and downs and different dangers and advantages, so that is why you always have to be careful with how you use these platforms; there are disadvantages, like  cyberbullying and scams, but on the other hand, it has many advantages, like business growth and easier connection to people. Firstly, the disadvantages, like  cyberbullying, can come in many different forms, like stalking,  bad-mouthing and exposing. Stalking is a very serious crime that can get a person a couple of years in jail, but when stalking occurs online, it is very hard to detect it; and as for  bad-mouthing, it is often used amongst teenagers, and the effect of that can lead to very serious consequences, like depression and suicide. In addition, many different scams have occurred mostly on social media since it is easier to fool a customer, and that has led to many legal issues between businesses and customers, and there are many different scams, like voice phishing, which usually scams people to get their credit card information. Secondly, the advantages of social media are huge. Businesses have prospered with the help of social media because social media helps to connect many to one another; and since it does that, it opens doors to a lot of diversity among [INCOMPLETE]
How does social media affect individuals and society? Ayesha Marwan Al-Mehairi Social media is a modern platform that can be used in different ways; it can be used for entertainment purposes or even educational ones. For years, scientists have been researching whether social media affects individuals and society or whether it doesn't affect them at all. Here are a couple of reasons why I believe social media affects individuals and society. Firstly, famous people who use social media affect the way the viewer (the person who is watching the famous person) thinks. The viewer in most chances gets influenced by the actions done by the famous person, and the actions affect society as they're being applied in the real world and not just the Internet (social media in that case). Secondly, it physically affects them in a way that they get convinced to do the same things that famous people do. For instance, there was the  """Kiki," Do You Love "Me?"""  challenge, and thousands have participated. This simply proves that thousands, or even millions, of people get affected by social media. Lastly, it is the most common way of communicating in the modern days. Research has proved that documents sent by literal mail aren't being used as much as they used to be back in the 80s and 90s. The modern """mail""" is social media, which is sending messages to loved ones. Documents are sent by email nowadays. Again, I personally believe that social media affects individuals and society, and I hope the reasons that I applied above convince you as a reader that social media does affect people.
In our generation, people - and mostly the younger ones - use social media more than communicating with people around them. The social media has a huge impact on each and every individual. It all depends on how they use it in their daily lives. Many users benefit a lot from it, while others do not. For example, many people follow these influencers that might help them be more confident about themselves, such as how to communicate with others or what is trending now, whether it's in fashion or some delicious food recipes. However, the younger ones get influenced by them in a different way that  might do them harm instead of helping them. For instance, if a kid watches videos on YouTube of people doing illegal activities, such as ruining the government properties or destroying someone's belongings as a form of entertainment, this kid might do the exact same behavior, which will lead to parents punishing the child for these mad behaviors. Social media and social media influencers should have a great impact and be a way of guiding people to do better in their lives. Parents should be more careful about how their kids use the social media for communicating instead of communicating with people around them.
Addiction Social media is a platform that holds many things for everyone, and many people see it as something very valuable to them. However, social media has such a huge effect on our society; apps like Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook are used by almost all of us, and we are addicted to those apps. Many men and women are affected by what is spread through social media about how you should look,  what is considered beautiful and what is considered masculine, which puts them in a state of depression, which can give them suicidal thoughts as well as eating disorders since many women follow the trends on social media on what their body should look like and what  an ideal body is, in addition to men who use steroids to gain muscle since it is considered attractive and shows a sense of masculinity. Also, teenagers getting bullied and harassed on social media are not a surprise; many users would bully younger girls for how they look, how their hair looks or their makeup, and this has various effects on teens because they see how they look as something important, and if it is not up to the standards of what social media wants, they get bullied online, which lowers their  self-confidence. Harassment is also another thing that affects a majority of women; when users comment on their posts - and usually they are not very friendly and there are outrageous comments, this makes women and younger girls feel vulnerable on their own social media platform. In conclusion, social media has such a big impact on everyone,  has many disadvantages and does not have a good side. It changes people and turns them into people who are obsessed with how they look,  what they have,  the shape of their body and if they fit in or not. In the end, these are all just opinions from people, and everyone is amazing in their own way, and no one has to follow anything to fit in.
Social media plays an important part in humans' life. It can be used to connect and communicate with people from all around the world in just simple and short steps. There are also several usages for social media other than communicating with people. Social media can affect us and our society in many different ways - mentally and physically. As individuals, our priority is to have our cell phones and to access  our social media applications to capture our special moments and share them with  the world. Many others use them as a way to gain more money by advertising their businesses, etc. Social media can affect people's mental health if it is used in the wrong way, such as when someone would use it all day long without living the moment and enjoying it. Moreover, having social media can open you to many different types of comments, which might also include negative comments, which will result in making you feel horrible about yourself. However, It affects the society in both a positive and a negative way - positive, such as influencers who have a great impact on the society and help it in many different ways, and negative, such as bad comments or bad content that might disturb the viewers or leave a bad impact on them. In conclusion, social media will always be a spectacular addition to human living in several types and ways. Being able to go around the world and getting introduced to different perspectives, just by using social media, is fascinating and amazing.
Social media has become a big part of our life   nowadays. The media helps connect different types of people from around the world together; that can be a positive thing for a lot of people, especially for people who conduct different studies around the world and want to share them with the rest of the population. Social media offers most people a platform  to start their careers on  to help them rise to fame and make them more known to the rest of the world. Society can come together,  helps each other out through using social media,  helps raise awareness about the problems and difficulties and trys to start somewhere to solve the problem. Individuals can be either positively affected or negatively affected by the media - positively, by finding support groups or following people that affect their life in a good way and helping them change for the best, and negatively,   by spreading hate towards a person or a group of people. It can also be by carrying out dangerous activities and streaming them online for viewers to see; and mostly, younger viewers of the media are most likely to be influenced and drawn to such bad or illegal activities, which can put them at a higher risk of falling in trouble with the law or even their parents. All in all, social media can be a bad place and a good place for users to enjoy; it's just how you chose to use it that can affect you and the people that surround you.
Did you ever think that social media will play a big role in societies?  Social media plays a huge role in these days;  people nowadays communicate with others on social media rather than talking to individuals  normally face to face.  Moreover, social media can impact negatively on students by dropping their grades lower than the percentage, and it enables cheating in exams,  which many students will find  a good way to process.  As a student, you should balance between your studies and your free time.  Additionally, social media will affect individuals by sharing their personal information with others, which might lead to the lack of privacy. 
Social media has started when things have developed all around the world. In the past, life was really hard; they didn't have the Internet, and it was really hard for them to study and communicate. After the developments, life became  easier. Social media has helped with too many things. Some people use social media in a really wrong way that affects them and the society. The cons of using social media are  sharing personal information, bullying people,  etc. People really need to be careful about using social media because it has many benefits; using it in the wrong way leads people to suicide and to do wrong things. Social media can also affect the society and make them hate each other and stop communicating; if that happened, the world will be full of hate and will ruin many things. In addition to this, people need to stop looking at each other in the wrong way cause many people on social media share their life and daily routine with people, so that makes people judge, and rumors will spread. Be careful while using social media because you don't know who is watching you or who is stalking you daily. Use it in a really good way to get the benefit of it, mind your own business and focus on your life - not on other people's life - and achieve your goals and success.
Social media Have you ever thought about how the social media affected you or your society? As it seems, the social media   affects  us in many ways;  you just have to be aware and use the social media in a good way to benefit you and your society.  Firstly,  the social media, just like """Google"","  """Twitter"","  """Instagram"","  """Snapchat""" and many other apps, have pros and cons, just like any other thing in our life; you just have to be in control  so the social media doesn't affect you in a bad way;  furthermore, the social media helps you to be aware of what is happening around you, just like how the weather is today,  the wars and today's news, so you don't have to read the newspaper anymore.  On the other hand,  the social media also affected the society to get much better day by day,  just like the companies and the other businesses that help the country and the people;  also, you can talk to whoever you want on the social media, even those who live far away from your country, and that makes you learn about new traditions and people,  so that will help you to build yourself  and your mind.  In my humble opinion, the social media changed our life in a good way;  without it, we wouldn't be where we are at the moment, so I am very grateful for how the social media affected us and the society.
The social media has a positive and negative effect on the individuals and the society. Mostly, all people around the world use social media. It has a negative side and a positive side.  Let's start with the negative.  People mostly spend their time on social media, which leads them to miss important things they need to do, for example,  study,  appointments, etc. Some of the popular people do things, and they post them without caring about what they post,  so kids just do things that the popular people do.  Some people use the social media in the wrong way and post personal things and information about themselves;   in this way, they put  themselves at risk. The positive side of social media is that people can communicate with other people in other countries so easily.  Also, we can have less time to do our things, like shopping. People also attend many classes on social media instead of going to them.  At the end, social media can affect  us in a negative way and in a positive way;  we need to know how to use it right and care about who's watching, whatever age they are. 
How does social media affect individuals and society? Social media, or as our elders call it: """trash""," has had a very big impact on today's society as it has played a big role by enlightening people about other cultures that are different from their own, which has created a  friendlier and peaceful environment. However, social media has had its negative impacts as it disattached people from reality and made face-to-face   interactions feel weird and awkward as if social media alienated human interactions. There are also people who say that social media helped individuals from different backgrounds to meet each other and destroy the barrier that was between them. Social media has also destroyed several stereotypes that people were fed by the mainstream media, which helped people get a better understanding of other cultures. Social media has also served as an outlet for people who are introverted and helped them with the transition into finally becoming extroverts. In conclusion, like every new invention, there are positives and negatives, but I think that social media's positives exceed its negatives, and it has helped way more than it has harmed. So people should stop concerning themselves with what's wrong with it and start focusing on how to improve it.
How does social media affect individuals and society?  Nowadays, communication has become much faster and easier compared to 20 years ago; for instance,   one of the biggest differences were caused by social media networks. Social media allows us to communicate and share pictures or videos and a lot of other things quickly, and it requires no effort at all - one click could send a huge amount of data.  In the other hand,  we all know that everything has pros and cons to it,  and that applies to social media sites too. Don't get me wrong; those networks are useful if you need to look for information,  or if you miss someone across the globe and you want to communicate with them, but those applications can be so dangerous if they are used by the wrong individuals or used with bad intentions; for example, children younger than 10, in my opinion, are too innocent and immature for the ideas and the content that is provided on those sites. Social media also causes some health issues, such as damage to  eyesight, pain in the hands or back and neck pain  along with the bad influence on the young users, such as strict beauty standards, bad language  and more. Those networks do not only affect individuals,  but they also can affect the society in a variety of ways. Social media can break close friendships, relationships and, unfortunately, families because it could limit face-to-face communication and physical touch too. It also may be a huge cause of laziness and the decrease in productivity, whether it is a student or an employee. Social media is not harmful if you use it carefully and with the right intentions.
When was the last time you checked one of your social media accounts? It must be recently. Most of us use social media nowadays; some of us are even obsessed with it. Social media is what makes us connected to the world; we reach whatever we want with a one-finger press. Social media has many effects on our life; some of them are positive, while others are negative. From my point of view, I see that it depends on the way we use it.  Social media made our life easier; you can contact with people all around the world through texting or video calls using different applications, like  FaceTime.  It was never easy before to see someone who lives far away from you in such a way. Parents can stay connected to their children who study abroad, and friends can keep in touch with each other. By using social media, you can express your thoughts and feelings and find people who share the same thoughts as you. It is easy to have some discussions and exchange opinions on social media accounts, such as Twitter. I think social media brought the society closer. On the other hand, social media can become a bad idea if we did not use it in a proper way.  Younger people may use their social media account to bully their colleagues, and this will cause problems for both sides. In addition, if we kept using social media all the time, we may become less social and might have some health problems. Social media was made to keep us communicated, so we should not use it and forget the real-life  relationships. Social media is a great method, and it's necessary in the modern world; we should use it wisely to improve  ourselves and our society.
All of us know that social media affects  everything in a bad way and in a good way as well; it affects groups, individuals and society as well. In my paragraph, I will only mention the good effects of social media on groups and society; so firstly, as a question,  what are the positive effects of social media on people?  There are many, actually. First of all, it helps people to know new people around the world - people with a new culture and attitude. Second, there are many volunteering groups and activities in our country; how do we know about that?  Social media is the main introducer of those activities; we can know the name,  the day, the date and the time of the activity, how many volunteers they need and whether the needed volunteers are males or females. That is amazing!!   Then, there are many people who had their own business ideas, so the social media is the best way to introduce their work and ideas to people; actually, with the new update as well  (Highlights),  they can put their prices,  ideas and everything. Last but not least, there are many people around the world who can give us some advice about many things; people who went through a lot of experiences and  have learned from these experiences  pass the lesson to others. That is useful, actually; we learn from them and we pass the information to others and to our family and friends. Last, there are a lot of accounts on social media that teach you how to cook; that is amazing; you learn while you are at home. At the end, I would like to end my paragraph with  advice use social media for benefits; let the world be a better place because of us. Thank you.
Nowadays, we cannot  say that we are controlling our life. The fact is totally different. Our life is controlled by how people see us. We just act the way that they want us to, and we forget to be ourselves. We are acting and showing our behaviours to other people by using social media, but at the same time, some people get the real benefit from these social media and improve  theirselves. So social media is a two-sided sword, and depending on which side you are using, it will affect our life. For most of us, social media made the world a small village. We can contact with diverse people, either from the south or from the north. It became easier for us to understand how other people think, or instead of doing exceptions for the people who are far away from us, we easily connect with them. Social media becomes a strong platform to share your ideas and let your voice  be heard. Now, we can talk about our rights or support other nations to get them heard. Sharing information, documents, pictures or even reports and news is available now! Social media made the nation much developed. It is easy now for people to study and learn new languages. As a result, this  can improve the country's economy and will let the country get a lot of knowledge. As we mentioned before that social media is a two-sided sword. It can affect our life in the opposite way and ruin our relationship with others. The number of  cyberbullying is getting higher than ever before. People who are suffering from back pain and eye vision are rising more quickly. It is extremely dangerous that we are  no longer close to our family. All these individual effects can have  consequences for our society. People are getting lazy and just want to be on their phones. The number of workers who are focused is getting lower than ever before. In my opinion, depending on how we use social media, it will affect us, either in a good way - by using the advantages in the right way - or a bad way, which  lets the social media enter our life and control us instead of us having to control it.
Individuals and Society Social media  nowadays is all around the world. People can easily get connected to others by just entering an application, such as WhatsApp, Snapchat or Instagram. The social media has some positive and negative effects on both individuals and society. It depends on how the person is using the application. Social media has a positive effect on individuals when they are using it for education, maybe, such as making research or gathering information through chatting with other people who are related to the topic they are making the research on. It can also be positive when they use it to watch people who are there to support people and give them some instructions that make their lives better. Social media has a positive effect on the society when all people maybe are connected in a WhatsApp group, and they share ideas or videos that have some content that gives people some ways for their life to be better or something that may make them aware of things, such as a virus that is spread through a link or a program. Social media will have a negative effect on  individuals and society when they will be using it in the wrong way. When kids will be spending time on social media to just watch videos, such as """How" to play a certain "game""" or """How" to make a prank or "activities""," this will be a negative effect on the individuals because some of them have an addiction to these programs, so they will not care about their education and homework. When individuals use social media to contact with other people who spread negativity between them, this is a bad effect. I see that the biggest bad effect that the social media made in the society is that people do not bother to see or meet each other anymore; they always prefer to stay at home and use the social media programs to contact with each other. The other negative effect is that when people are sitting together in a coffee shop, maybe, or a family gathering, all of them are playing with their phones and forgetting that they are all sitting together, and this makes the old people angry because their kids don't bother to talk with them - they are only playing with their phones. According to my personal information, I see that social media affects people, depending on the way they use it. Parents should always check on their kids - how they are using the programs, just to make a better society that spreads positivity.
Starting off, the United Arab Emirates has always been a developed country, although, in the past, it didn't have those ideas about building towers and malls; it was mostly just using camels for transportation and for feeding  itself. Today, the United Arab Emirates is probably one of the most developed countries, going from its fancy restaurants that are located in high places to see spectacular views and moving on to the different roads that have been created throughout  the years, whereas   the city called Dubai  is famous for its very tall towers,  how it has been built and lots more. Yet these ideas have come from different religions and countries and have probably combined all of their unique and great ideas together, where that's one of the reasons why the United Arab Emirates has developed so fast and in an intelligent way. Another reason is  how much population came into  the country from different countries; it made the country better and wider. Till this very moment, the UAE is still willing to come up with more  great minds to have a great outcome and a safer place for others. In conclusion, the UAE would love to come up with more and would build more throughout  the years, and the  great minds of people of any nationality that have unique  ideas, that would actually do something great for this world,    are more welcomed to share them with us today.
Social media    plays a big role in these days, and it affects our life in many different ways. We live in the days where everything works on technology, and we are so attached to it that we think that we cannot live our life without it - but not really, and the fact is that we did not understand yet  how effective it is on our mental and physical health. Social media is a part of our life; it is the place where we can find the news and the new developments that  reached us recently. As a person who uses social media, I can see how it is important in my life because I cannot wake in the morning without checking my social media and checking what is going around me. The social media has replaced the paper news because we can know everything immediately on the social media; I personally  do not go out often because it is easier for me to contact others on the social media, and I think it is a bad habit because we do not move much, which affects our health, like having a lack of vitamins, obesity and lack of social communication in real life. People should use social media but not too much because when you spend a lot of your time on social media, it sometimes gets more like an addiction, where some people do suicide because of this addiction. I think we should get used to not using social media a lot,  live our life and live more freely because, in my opinion, social media is like a prison to our souls.
Social media is a huge gate to transfer to virtual life; its  big community includes mixed religions from all around the world. As we all know, we are using social media applications to connect with others,  chat and share our routine in different ways. Everything in this world has two sides: good effects and bad effects, so it depends on how we deal with it.  Nowadays, social media apps are a good gateway to explore the world; like other cultures or new friendships could change our lifestyle, or we can find people or groups who have the same interest we have. Even, there are effects on the society. These days, social media became such a  famous way to broadcast any information or newsletters, and that's a good way to make the community know about what's happening around the world and make new opportunities for those searching for a job in both sectors: private or government. In my opinion, if we used the social media in a good way, it will reflect on us in a good way too,  so being respectful to others on these gateways is so important to build  good relationships.
 Social media  Who doesn't own social media accounts nowadays? I think that it is one of the most important issues these days!  Everyone uses it as an everyday routine, whether adults, kids or teenagers.  As you know, social media can affect us in so many different ways;  it has a lot of advantages for each society; first, it is the best way to communicate with your friends and family; it can save a lot of time and money instead of using phone calls or visiting them. Next, you can get some new knowledge by looking at other countries' cultures through posts that people share from all around the world!  Also, you can learn new languages by getting new friends from different countries. Finally, it made our life much easier! On  social media, you can know about online shopping applications or websites so you can shop when you are at home!  No need to go to malls or shopping centers. There are many more advantages to social media that you can find and explore by yourself. On the other hand, of course, there have to be some disadvantages to social media applications; one of the biggest disadvantages is the less amount of moving!  Some of us can sit on their phones checking Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and Facebook  for much   time!  It could take between 3-6 hours daily!  Also, wasting time is a big issue too; we can cancel some of our important daily plans or work only to stay online with friends or family; another thing that we suffer from because of social media is lack of sleep!  Sleep hours became lesser after using social media; we stay up all night only to be connected to the world for 24 hours! In conclusion, social media is a good thing for our society when we manage it in the right way; otherwise, it's too harmful to us.
There is no doubt that social media is becoming increasingly important in today's world. It's one of the most important ways to contact with the others;  there is a big role for social media in our life, and everything  in our lives has an impact on individuals and society, but there is a good side and a bad side. It's commonly known that social media is useful for most of the people, but I have, and you have, to know how to use it in a good way because this may affect  the others; for instance, the famous girls  have a very healthy  lifestyle and perfect body and skin, so when the adults or women see  that, they will try to be the same as this girl, but they don't know that she has a different life behind the screen; she's actually not showing her whole life so we don't know about her problems;  only  we know that she has an amazing life and skin. I  think also social media makes the person go away from his life; it makes him busy and lazy about doing the works; only you can manage this. On the other hand, I claim that social media has more positive sides; on social media, the people can exchange  experience, and that makes the society developed;  also, social media helps us and motivates us to bring out our talent, and it's a good chance to know our talent and help our country to be in the first positions. In the end, there are bad things and good things in everything,  so you have to choose the way that you want.
The UAE has developed a lot in the past few years, especially in Dubai, and soon there will be many more developments. All around the world, people are waiting for Expo 2020 because of the many other changes that will be in Dubai and maybe in the other emirates. The UAE is that kind of a country that can develop very easily; many companies, like Emaar, can post things about the UAE culture on Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter and other social media because  nowadays, like 5% of people  don't use social media, so it's so easy to know about every country's culture on the Internet. I think that  some people travel through a travel agency and introduce our culture outside. You can also shoot a video and upload it on your  YouTube channel so that many YouTube users watch it and learn something about us - but something good and deserving wasting some time watching  because many people film something useless, no need for it. Our government can also check the content before the people upload or post anything. I think that the most important development was, and will be,  Expo 2020; I can't wait for that time; I know many beautiful things will be shown, and I hope I get a chance to enter.
The Internet and social media are a huge amount of websites that connect people to each other worldwide,  starting from families and friends to huge facilities and workshops; however, the Internet has made  huge changes in the past 50 to 60 years; in this paragraph, we will be talking about social media in specific ways and how  it affects the individuals and the society. In my opinion, I think that social media is affecting the society and the individuals in the wrong way  because a lot of people keep comparing  what they have with what others have,  so it makes them feel unsatisfied with what they have and ungrateful too,  so it leads them to keep spending a lot of money on silly stuff, just for show, and that's wrong. Some people might say, """No," social media can be good "too."""  Well yes, in some ways, social media can help people to be more social and to communicate with each other, such as talking to a friend in America while you're in the UAE  or  getting works done; so yeah, social media has its positives and negatives;  it actually depends on how much time you spend on social media and how well you can  control yourself. 
Social media has affected our lives in an unbelievable way; it became an important thing in our daily life, and I think that it helps us sometimes to get through many things in our day. I think that social media has some effects on society and individuals. First, the effects of the social media on individuals are a lot; it may have effects on your eyes, it makes some people less social in real life, but in the social media, they have a different personality and it may affect your relationships because, sometimes, when we talk in reality, it is better to understand each other more. Secondly, there are lots of effects on the society, where having problems with family  can be a negative effect on the society; people will lose their communication with each other, and some kids may be irresponsible to their parents or relatives who can also be affected. In conclusion, social media has a lot of impact on our lives, which can be on individuals or on the society; we can help each other to get over the negative effects by having a connection between you and your relatives and friends in real life - not to our phones - and making this connection stronger.
